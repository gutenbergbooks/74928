  <p>The average intelligence of the Cycling fraternity can, with justice,
    be said to be above that of any other association of men and women,
    devoted to pastime, sport, and exercise, in the world; yet withal it is
    with some considerable feeling of anxiety that this book is sprung upon
    them. There can be no question but that we are a reading community,
    and yet all attempts catering to our wants, in the way of books, seem
    to have met with a less hearty support than should have been expected.
    The author of one of the greatest works connected with Cycling has
    recently informed us that he is still many hundreds of dollars behind,
    and other authors have good reason to complain that their books can
    be searched for even at club-houses, where they surely ought to be
    found. Books consisting largely of advertisements have, no doubt,
    paid the compilers, as have also the numerous periodicals, but when
    we ponder over the colossal efforts of Kron and Stevens, and think of
    the poorly-rewarded devotion of Sturmey, “Faed,” the Pennels, Stables,
    Cortis, and others, the encouragement is not at all stimulating to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
    writers; especially since all books of these authors are of the most
    attractive character and easily comprehended, whereas a large portion
    of this work is written with a view to inspiring a close study of the
    art, and for that reason, if for no other, is liable to be dry reading.
    However, it is too late now to swerve from the task; if one more must
    be added to the procession of dejected, empty-pocketed venturers, “so
    mote it be.”</p>

  <p>No petition is made to the Fraternity to read this book in particular,
    but it is hoped that all cycling books and periodicals will be
    patronized, hereafter, with the usual liberality so characteristic of
    wheelmen in connection with other matters, and if this work should,
    in any way, foster this hope, its mission will be more than filled.
    In one way the writer has already been amply repaid; if he had never
    undertaken this task it is just possible that he, like many others,
    might never have followed a cycler through India, or have made the
    acquaintance of “The Best of Bull-Dogs.”</p>

  <p>The nature of this book has drifted, to some extent, from the rigid
    mathematical character originally intended, partially because it just
    drifted, and also perhaps intentionally, in order to give it a more
    popular bearing. If some severely practical readers should notice an
    attempt at humor, or an amusing turn given to what should be stern
    mathematical or mechanical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span> reasoning, it is hoped that it will not be
    considered undignified or trivial, for it is done with an object; and
    if the popular reader should be averse to running off into abstract
    theories, let him but remember how little we realize that everything
    we do, or make, in our daily experience rests upon some fundamental
    principle which we ought to know and be able to explain. Who would
    have thought that the principles underlying the simple matter of
    balancing a bicycle would confuse even a school-boy? Perhaps it ought
    not; nevertheless, the article on that subject is cut rather short,
    for the reason that the writer, even with the help of others more
    competent, was unable to definitely determine all points in regard to
    it. My thanks are due to Prof. E. W. Davis, of Columbia, S. C., Gustav
    Bissing, Ph.D., of Baltimore; Prof. Robinson, of Columbus, Ohio; F. R.
    Smith, A.M., of Cambridge, England, and others, for valuable assistance
    courteously rendered.</p>

  <p>Locomotion as applied to the question of transportation of matter in
    all its varied forms has always been, and will always continue to be,
    one of the great problems of advancing civilization. To such an extent
    does the element of transportation enter into our highly organized
    system of society that it is said to be the most powerful factor in the
    evolution of man. So confidently is this believed, that a great genius
    has been led to promulgate the theory that at some future time man will
    consist of a head and trunk; that all use for the limbs being entirely
    dispensed with in the art of moving and manipulating matter, these will
    gradually shrivel up and drop off, as it has been said the tail did
    when we no longer used it for swinging our bodies from tree to tree,
    like the proverbial monkey, or as a projectile force so valuable to the
    locomotion of the kangaroo.</p>

  <p>The development of mechanical means for transporting and manipulating
    all matter has, to a wonderful extent, excused the use of man’s legs
    and arms: and the facility with which a great mass is loaded for
    transportation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span> delivered at its destination, and there manipulated
    with scarcely the touch of human hands has, it must be admitted,
    greatly diminished the labor otherwise delegated to the limbs. It is
    possible that almost all matter could be moved, moulded into desirable
    form, and utilized by civilized man for all his requirements, by the
    use of mechanical means, and man could no doubt transport himself by
    the same means, without using his limbs, and thereby reach a very high
    state of civilization; but such means must include a great amount of
    mechanical appliance accompanying the transportation, the more in
    proportion to each as the number of travellers is less in the same
    circuit.</p>

  <p>Now, I think we can well admit that the very highest state of
    advancement will be marked by the greatest facility each man has to go
    his own way, and when we come to think of the world crowded as it must
    eventually become, does it not seem apparent to the reader that, since
    the natural energy now encompassed within our system is sufficient
    to carry us about, it will be for the best to continue to use this
    energy in our locomotion and make our improvements with the view to
    such a use, not for the purpose of dispensing with the many mechanical
    conveniences that now subserve our demands, but in order to add a
    simple and convenient means of unit transportation over reasonably long
    distances in a reasonably short space of time and accomplish the same
    with the least possible increase of mechanism? Humanity without the
    power to transport itself is to us an almost incomprehensible idea, and
    at the present day it is almost equally hard to conceive the state of
    society in which the movement of large masses over even small distances
    was impossible; yet there was a time when man could do no more than
    transport himself, together with such articles as he could carry upon
    his back or hold in his hands. It was probably not till long after this
    that he constructed a sled from the bark of a great tree to receive
    his chattels,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span> and pulled it along by some rude vine; still nearer to
    our own time comes the invention of the wheeled vehicle or wagon, and
    when we come to that marvel of modern inventive genius the railway and
    steam-driven locomotive we are within a period yet personally known to
    our oldest fellow-citizens.</p>

  <p>So much inventive ingenuity, so much marvellous energy has been
    expended upon the solution of the problem of transporting large masses,
    in which we see the wheel has finally played an important part, that
    the question of the individual transportation of individual men has
    received comparatively little attention, and it is only within the last
    twenty-five years that an amount of labor and thought has been given
    to this problem at all commensurate with its importance. This recent
    labor and thought has not been expended in vain; it has placed the man,
    too, upon the wheel, which has done so much towards developing the use
    of other energy, and at last there spreads out before him a beautiful
    vista of independent locomotion unexampled in all the previous

  <p>As wheel suggests the name “cycle,” let us call this art, appertaining
    to the man and the wheel, “The Cycle Art,” or, more definitely, if we
    wish, the art of “Man-Motor Carriages.”</p>

  <div class="subheadc">THE CYCLE ART.</div>

  <p>Posterity will always consider this the embryo generation of the
    cycling art; it might well be termed the “living wheel age.”</p>

  <p>A number of valuable books have been written on the fundamental
    principles of locomotion by means of walking, riding upon animate
    beings, flying and creeping, and also upon all kinds of inanimate or
    mechanical motors, but little has been said about physical properties
    underlying the intervention of a wheel between the body of man and the
    surface to be travelled over, the motor being man himself.</p>

  <p>The interesting art of man-motor carriages has already developed
    an industry of such great importance that the certainty as to its
    permanency is beyond cavil, and, believing that it will yet assume much
    greater proportions and become of more and more absorbing interest,
    there seems to be some excuse for an attempt to place even a limited
    amount of personal information before those connected with the industry
    and before the admirers of the art. There are few industries the
    product of which is dispersed among so varied a class of patrons, and
    scarcely none in which the patron takes so lively an interest in the
    respective articles produced.</p>

  <p>In most industries, where a machine is the product, the consumer is
    expected to be an expert in the art to which the industry appertains,
    and is therefore supposed to be capable of individual judgment as to
    the merits of what he acquires; if a steam-engine is the object of the
    purchase, it is expected that an expert of some ability in the art
    will judge of and afterwards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span> run and repair it; but how could this be
    expected with a bicycle?</p>

  <p>There is probably no other machine used by mankind, with the possible
    exception of the watch, that does service to such a variety of
    individuals as the cycle. Now, it would be of little use to write a
    book for popular reading on the mechanical construction of a watch,
    because from its very nature none but an expert could appreciate the
    facts, if any were given; but greater hope might be entertained in
    regard to a larger machine, because the buyer can at least see what
    he is about. You never heard of a bicycle-rider blaming his repairer
    for stealing the wheels out of his machine and substituting others,
    because he can see, however inexperienced he may be, that this has
    not been done. Now, if we all could, by a little observation, learn
    one-half as much about our watches as we can about our bicycles, the
    poor watch-maker would never suffer the indignities so universally
    and unjustly heaped upon him. The primary knowledge above hinted at
    as possible, among the hoped-for patrons of this work, seems to be an
    auspicious circumstance in connection with an effort to teach them a
    little more.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“We find in a great number of standard treatises a sort of
      accusation brought against nature for having entirely wasted a
      great part of the force of our muscles by causing them to act under
      a disadvantageous leverage.”—<span class="smcap">E. J. Marey.</span><a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>À propos of fundamental principles, what are the requirements needful
    for the most successful means of man-motor locomotion? In more homely
    phrase, how can a man, without calling upon the storage of energy other
    than that inherent in his own body, propel himself from place to place
    with the least amount of physical exertion? It is evident now, that
    under very many circumstances the means provided us by the Creator
    for such purposes are not the most economical; that is to say, it has
    been found that if we employ a medium through which to transmit our
    energy, the energy will be more economically expended, in carrying our
    bodies from place to place, than if we apply the force directly to the
    work as nature seemed to intend in presenting us with a pair of legs.
    The writer cheerfully concedes, for one, that for almost all purposes
    the legs are very practical; as, for instance, in climbing a tree or
    a pair of stairs, a rail fence, or even a very steep hill, or when,
    as in some of our early travels, we are compelled by an embarrassing
    paucity of funds to take to the cross-ties of a poorly ballasted
    railroad. And further, we admit that the invention of a pair of legs,
    if properly claimed in a patent, would, with perfect justice, have
    entitled the inventor to all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span> uses to which they could be put, including
    the pumping of a bicycle. But we are perfectly willing to infringe the
    leg patent, provided we can improve upon it even for certain purposes,
    as we have in adopting the modern bicycle, in its use, for instance,
    upon a reasonably smooth level road. Why we have been able to thus
    improve upon nature’s device is not quite clear. Undoubtedly, however,
    there is some unnecessary friction in the leg method; it cannot be on
    account of impact with the air, because a man on a bicycle certainly
    catches as much air himself, in addition to that of the machine, as
    he would do in walking. Evidently, then, there must be more motion or
    extra friction or both in the body, in the leg method, than is really
    essential in conveying one over a good road. Probably the main cause
    of this friction is that the rider’s body is supported differently; it
    requires less muscular strain to sit than to stand. We not only know
    this from experience, but it is proved by the fact that the temperature
    of the body is lower while sitting than while standing; also still
    lower when lying down, showing that less energy is being expended and
    less muscle consumed. Since the spirit of the writer began to wrestle
    with the foregoing leg versus cycle controversy, by happy chance he
    fell upon an estimable work<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> of which a careful perusal would almost
    make us think that nature really had an embryo cycle or wheel method
    in view when we were planned for legs. The great interest attaching to
    the above-mentioned work arises from the fact that the book was written
    before the cycle was at all broadly known to be of any assistance to
    the self-propulsion of man under any circumstances. This work must be
    read to be appreciated. I give some quotations, the application of
    which shows that, in the minds of some, the Creator had an idea of a
    wheel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span> within a wheel; in short, that nature seemed to want to roll.</p>

  <p>Let us quote from page 51, “Animal Locomotion.”</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“When the right leg is flexed and elevated, it <em>rotates</em> upon
      its iliac portion of the trunk in a forward direction to form
      the <em>arch</em> of a <em>circle</em> which is the converse of that
      formed by the right foot, if the <em>arcs</em> alternately supplied
      by the right foot and the trunk are placed in opposition, a more
      or less <em>perfect circle</em> is produced, and thus it is that the
      locomotion of animals is approximated to the wheel in mechanics.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Hence we <em>roll</em>,—but not far enough,—we approximate in nature, but
    reach the goal by man’s genius; shown in the full circular wheel.</p>

  <p>It will be seen from the following (p. 51) that the bones in man are
    not arranged for high speed; hence we must make up for this deficiency.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“The speed attained by man, although considerable, is not
      remarkable; it depends on a variety of circumstances, such as
      height, age, sex, and muscular energy of the individual, the
      nature of the surface to be passed over, and the resistance to
      forward motion due to the presence of air whether still or moving.
      A reference to the human skeleton, particularly its inferior
      extremities, will explain why the speed should be moderate.”</p>

    <p>Page 52. “Another drawback to great speed in man (as distinguished
      from animals) is, ... part of the power which should move (serve as
      a motive power) ... is dedicated to supporting the trunk.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Now, in the cycle method we support the trunk all right, but should
    apparently make more use of the arms,—inventors take notice.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Page 56. “In this respect the human limbs, when allowed to
      <em>oscillate</em>, exactly resemble a <em>pendulum</em>.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Here is the trouble with nature; there is too much oscillation instead
    of continuous rotation; nature does not go far enough.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Page 58. “The trunk also <em>rotates</em> in a forward direction on
      the foot which is placed on the ground for the time being; the
      <em>rotation</em> begins at the heel and terminates at the toes.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Thus the rotation is all right so far as it goes.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Page 60. “The right side of the trunk has now reached its highest
      level and is in the act of <em>rolling</em> over the right foot.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Hence see the effort of nature to roll.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Page 61. “In traversing a given distance in a given time a tall
      man will take fewer steps than a short man, in the same way that a
      large <em>wheel</em> will make fewer revolutions in travelling over
      a given space than a smaller one. The nave of a large <em>wheel</em>
      corresponds to the ilio-femoral articulation (hip-joint) of the
      tall man, the <em>spokes</em> to his legs, and portions of the
      <em>rim</em> to his feet.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>We thank nature very much for this suggestion of the wheel; without it
    perhaps we should never have conceived of the veritable wheel itself.</p>

  <p>I also find from another work:<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“Living beings have frequently and in every age been compared to
      machines, but it is only in the present day that the bearing and
      the justice of this comparison is fully comprehensible.”</p>

    <p>Page 67. “One might find in the animal organism many other
      appliances the arrangement of which <em>resembles</em> that of
      <em>machines</em> invented by man.”</p>

    <p>Page 91. “Let us examine from this point of view the articulation
      in the foot of man: we see in the tibio-tarsal articulation a
      <em>curvature</em> of small <em>radius</em>.”</p>

    <p>Page 112. “In addition to this the body is inclined and drawn up
      again; at each movement of one of the legs it <em>revolves</em> on a
      pivot.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>And so on in all works on animal locomotion will ever be found a
    continual reference to radius, roundness, and rolling.</p>

  <p>These quotations show that while we must acknowledge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span> that the
    fundamental principles involved in the cycle were anticipated, to a
    certain extent, by nature, we may yet take great credit upon ourselves
    for developing the new or improved method to such a perfect and useful
    degree.</p>

  <p>To the oscillating features found in the human organism the genius of
    man has added a full circular revolving mechanism, pushing further
    nature’s aspiration to roll. Nature rolls a little, and then rolls back
    again; man has so improved upon himself by the addition of a wheel that
    he can roll on forever. It is quite evident that by such means he saves
    much energy; let us now determine if possible how this saving can be
    still further increased.</p>

  <p>The whole question of the advantages of the cycle method or wheel
    locomotion must resolve itself into one of reduction of organic
    friction as shown by fatigue in the body. All inorganic friction, such
    as metallic friction in the machine and upon the road, must be finally
    overcome at the expense of organic friction due to the exercise of the
    muscles in man. Without stopping to discuss such profound questions as
    to just what organic friction is, or as to how the display of energy
    creates friction, we will confine ourselves to the more tangible
    problem,—to wit, improvements upon the improvement; that is to say,
    granting the cycle method to be an improvement upon the leg method, we
    will discuss improvements in the cycle method.</p>

  <p>We feel perfectly justified, from our own experience and observation,
    in adopting, as a basis upon which to build all future improvements,
    the broad principle underlying the intervention of continually rolling
    wheels between the rider and his road-way. Now, we ask, what are the
    requirements appertaining particularly to this wheel method?</p>

  <p>In order to approach the subject logically, I repeat that the
    fundamental requirement is the reduction of organic friction or fatigue
    of the body.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span></p>

  <p>The above requirement is met in two ways: First, directly; that is to
    say, by working the muscles of the body to the best possible advantage;
    secondly, indirectly, by reducing the inorganic friction such as is
    found in the machine and in its action upon the road.</p>

  <p>We shall attack first the reduction of direct organic friction by
    discussing the manner of applying the energy of man to revolve the
    wheel; his position and economy of power; and secondly, the reduction
    of the indirect or inorganic friction in the machine by regulating the
    size of the wheels and weight thereof, the jolt or jar, the friction of
    the parts one upon another, loss of momentum, and such other problems
    as may present themselves in the course of our discussion.</p>

  <p>The terms used in this book hereafter will be largely arbitrary.
    Man-motor and locomotive carriages, velocipedes, unicycles, bicycles,
    tricycles, tandems, and all such terms will be included more or less in
    the broad terms “cycle” and “cycle-method.” Wherever any distinctive
    feature is to be made prominent, then such qualifying adjuncts or
    special terms will be used as express it.</p>

  <p>In speaking of different styles of bicycles, we will adopt the name
    “Ordinary” for the prominent form of machine which is provided with a
    large wheel fifty to sixty inches in front, with a crank movement, and
    the usual fifteen- to twenty-inch rear wheel. The recent rear-crank
    driver, with the two wheels of about equal size, we will recognize as
    the “Rover” pattern, in deference to the people who first pushed it
    into the market and so named it. Other terms will be adopted which will
    be self-evident to all acquainted with the art.</p>

  <p>Attention is called to the engravings in Part II. of this book, which
    will give an idea of the different forms of machines used in the art.</p>

  <div class="subheadc">THE DIRECT APPLICATION OF POWER.</div>

  <p>It is evident that one of the greatest, if not the very greatest, of
    the requirements of a practical road wheel, or a man-motor carriage,
    is that the power of the rider shall be transmitted to the said wheel
    in the most direct manner possible; that is, by causing the strain
    to come upon the muscles in such a way that these muscles shall be
    placed in the best possible position to overcome such strain, and to
    take advantage of such conditions as nature has already provided for,
    in training our muscles to the work we have had to do under the old
    <i lang="fr">régime</i>, without the wheel.</p>

  <p>The muscles of man are best adapted to a direct pull or push. If we
    push upon a weight with the muscles at an angle to the direction in
    which we want the weight to move, the effective power is limited in the
    same way that the effect upon a weight is limited if we push at it in a
    direction at an angle to that in which we wish to move it; that is to
    say, not the total, but only a portion of the power will be effective
    in moving the weight.</p>

  <p>The above facts apply particularly to our subject when we desire to
    transmit motion to a wheel by means of the weight or gravity of our
    bodies. Gravity acting downward in a vertical line, if we are not
    placed over the resistance, the resultant effect is in proportion to
    the cosine of the angle at which we work, as follows:</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span></p>

  <p>Let <i>W</i> = the weight of the man and <i>a</i> be the centre of
    gravity and also the location of the source of power of said weight,
    and let <i>c</i> represent the point at which it is desired to apply
    the power to turn the wheel.</p>

  <figure class="figright illowp60" id="i_029">
    <img src="images/i_029.jpg" alt="">
    <figcaption>Power angle.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>Now, it is known that the weight <i>W</i>, acting by gravity in
    the direction <i>ab</i>, may be taken as proportional to the length
    of the line <i>ab</i>, and the portion of the pressure <i>P</i> in
    the direction <i>ac</i>, which will be effective to turn the wheel,
    may be taken as proportional to the length of the line <i>ac</i>;
    that is, <span class="frac"><sup><i>P</i></sup><sub> <i>W</i></sub></span>
    = <span class="frac"><sup><i>ac</i></sup><sub><i>ab</i></sub></span>,
    or <i>P</i> = <span class="frac"><sup><i>ac</i></sup><sub><i>ab</i></sub></span><i>W</i>,
    where <span class="frac"><sup><i>ac</i></sup><sub><i>ab</i></sub></span> is evidently
    always less than unity. Now, if the angle <i>bac</i> is thirty degrees,
    and <i>W</i> = 150 pounds, <i>W</i> times <span class="frac"><sup><i>ac</i></sup><sub><i>ab</i></sub></span> is
    130 pounds. Or, by trigonometry, the weight <i>W</i>, acting in the
    direction <i>ab</i>, by gravity as in working a cycle, will have a
    resultant in the direction <i>ac</i> representing the power acting
    to turn the wheel equal to <i>W</i> cos <i>bac</i>. If the angle
    <i>bac</i> is thirty degrees and <i>W</i> = 150 pounds, then <i>W</i>
    cos <i>bac</i> = 130 pounds. Now, in order to still get one hundred and
    fifty pounds of force on the wheel, a pull on the handle-bars would
    have to be given sufficient to make up the lost twenty pounds, which
    the rider would get without any pull on the bars if placed directly
    over the work. This pull, while not fatiguing to the legs beyond the
    necessary requirement of power, is an entire loss of work in the arms,
    and must tell on the system. This is all an additional loss to that
    which ensues from the fact that nature has fitted us to stand upright
    and not to work in an angular position; our every-day experience in
    walking gives us practice in a direct vertical strain on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span> the muscles
    of the body, and we should make it a point to apply our force as
    nature intended, in so far as it is applicable to our wheel method.
    These conditions apply more or less to any form of locomotion, and
    particularly to the cycle.</p>

  <p>From the foregoing remarks we are amply justified in drawing the
    conclusion that the resultant force available in the application of
    the physical power of man is in proportion to the cosine of the angle
    at which he exercises this force. We are well aware that many apparent
    variations will occur when so rigid a mathematical fact comes to be
    applied to the exercise of man’s energy in driving a bicycle; but all
    we care for is to lead the reader well up to the point by means of
    reasoning, which we hope will give at least a partial hypothesis for a
    conclusion well demonstrated by practical experience. We assert that
    when we consider the application of the <em>gravity</em> of the body to
    work on either a bicycle, or to other work of similar requirements,
    our mathematical demonstration is strictly true. It is justifiable,
    therefore, from a purely theoretical stand-point, to say that the rider
    of a bicycle wants to get directly over the work; let us see how our
    experience demonstrates this conclusion.</p>

  <p>Take first the differences between a modern ordinary bicycle and the
    old velocipede, or “bone-shaker,” so called. The former is lighter
    and better made; but the one great difference is that the rider is
    more nearly over his work. It was this one advance which encouraged
    the development of other minor differences which had been roughly
    thought out before. In fact, the Patent Office shows that many of these
    improvements were on record, but there would have been little use for
    them if the rider had not worked himself up into a place where he could
    do something. Just who raised him up from a midway position between
    the two wheels, the saddle seventy-five degrees back of the vertical
    through the drive-wheel axle, as in the old bone-shaker,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span> to nearly the
    top of the forward wheel, working at an angle of thirty degrees, as
    in some ordinaries, we will not attempt to say; but when he got there
    he has been willing, for a long time at least, to try to stay there,
    even at the expense of frequently going <em>down</em> on the other side,
    much to his annoyance, particularly as the general construction of the
    thing compelled him to go down the other end up, which end nature did
    not intend for terrestrial impact. It may as well be stated just here,
    however, that when our rider raised and moved his saddle forward he
    would have gone clear up to the vertical had it not been that it was
    absolutely impossible for him to stay there at all without hanging a
    heavy counter-balance somewhere in the neighborhood of the rear wheel,
    a scheme which, by the way, has been really recommended in modern cycle
    history.</p>

  <p>One excuse for dwelling upon the foregoing dissertation is that many
    casual observers and some riders, strange as it may seem, assert that
    in the development of the modern rear-driving Rover pattern, we have
    been retrograding to the old velocipede, whereas, in fact, we have made
    another step forward of a similar nature to that spoken of before in
    raising the rider up above the point of application of power. In the
    Rover machine we have landed the rider practically where, as before
    said, he could not remain at all before; but in this new machine he has
    gained the advantage of being able to stay there.</p>

  <p>Thus our rider has been gradually getting up and over the work.
    Various devices have been used in order to facilitate this operation,
    but, unfortunately for our power-development theory, many of the
    changes have been coupled with the safety feature so prominently that,
    in efforts by makers to place the rider in the best possible position
    for work, the safety feature is all that the casual observer has been
    able to see; therefore it is that in several machines, such as that
    called the “Extraordinary Challenge,” the sales have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span> been made more on
    the strength of safety than on their other great point of real merit,
    the advantage in power. In such machines, the rider has often been
    surprised to find that he had more power than he supposed, but having
    bought his mount with a view to safety, and it being still found to
    contain almost as great an element of risk as he before incurred,
    considerable disfavor has been the result. Had the element of increased
    power been thoroughly understood and appreciated, such machines would,
    in spite of the great deterioration in appearance, have been regarded
    more kindly.</p>

  <p>No better illustration in other arts of the desire and tendency of the
    operator to get over his work can be had than in that of the ordinary
    foot-lathe. No maker of lathes would think of attaching a treadle in
    such a manner that the workman could not perch himself directly over
    it. In some experiments on foot-lathes, the writer found that he could
    run at a given speed and resistance three times as long when over the
    work as when standing some twelve inches back and he had to reach out
    for it; in fact, it seems quite evident that our theoretical conclusion
    is fully established in actual practice.</p>

  <p>Granting then that the direct vertical application of power by the
    rider is a desirable acquisition, let it be called a fundamental
    requirement. It must not, however, be supposed, in this connection,
    that the foregoing in any way justifies the swimming position, or
    kicking back, which some experimenters have of late been prone to
    adopt. We must approach but never get beyond the vertical limit.</p>

  <p>Since this manuscript has been ready for the publisher, articles in the
    <cite>Bicycling News</cite> by “Warrior” and “Semi-Racer” have come under my
    notice, from which I clip sections, appertaining to this subject, as
    follows:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“If, as ‘Crawler’ says, it is a very great improvement to have the
      saddle well over the pedals, how comes it that the contrary is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span> now
      so universally advised, and as much as four inches recommended
      between the line of saddle-peak and the line of crank-axle? There
      never was a greater mistake made than when the saddle was generally
      placed in advance of the crank-axle. Apart altogether from its
      effect on the steering or easy running of the machine, there
      are two very strong reasons why the saddle should be kept well
      back. In the first place, it is quite impossible to sit upon the
      tuberosities designed by nature to carry the weight of the body
      unless the legs are flexed at the hip-joints. The parts resting
      upon the saddle are, otherwise, soft and delicate structures,
      liable to injury from the violence of the saddle. Were it for no
      other reason, this is enough to determine the position well to the
      rear of the crank-axle. But another reason: it is not a fact that
      one has greater power with the saddle, as suggested by ‘Crawler.’
      One may certainly throw his <em>weight</em> alternately upon either
      pedal readier, because he is nearer a standing position; but, on
      the other hand, with the saddle well back and the handles well
      forward, the purchase so obtained gives far greater power from
      muscular contraction than the mere weight of the body gives, and,
      indeed, many more muscles are called into action when the saddle is
      kept back.—<span class="smcap">Warrior.</span>”</p>

    <p>“With regard to gearing, I consider that the position of the rider
      has much to do with this also. A rider sitting well back can use
      his ankles much more effectively than one right over the pedals,
      and can consequently exert a driving force through a considerably
      greater part of the stroke, whereas the vertical rider depends
      chiefly upon the weight of his body during a comparatively short
      portion of the down stroke for propulsion, and upon the momentum of
      the machine to carry him over the dead centre. It will be found,
      therefore, that the rider using his ankles properly will be able to
      drive at least three inches higher with the same amount of force,
      and, at the same time, there is much more equable strain on the
      machine.—<span class="smcap">Semi-Racer.</span>”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The quotations show one great trouble in writing a book: such a long
    time elapses between writing and publishing, that new facts and
    opinions come up in the mean time which demand attention and suggest
    alteration, as, for instance, my former paragraph in regard to the
    swimming attitude should have been expanded.</p>

  <p>“Warrior” carries his theory to extremes. He is all right in cautiously
    avoiding an unduly-forward saddle, but when he places the front tip
    back of the vertical through the crank-axle, he goes too far and is
    utterly wrong.</p>

  <p>The cause for such diversity of opinion in this matter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span> is that it
    is tested under different circumstances. In riding over an easy,
    slightly rolling country, the tendency to get back on the saddle is
    indisputable, for reasons noted by “Warrior” and fully treated of in my
    chapter on “Saddles and Springs in Relation to Health;” but notice how
    we slip forward, almost off the saddle, when we have any work to do, as
    in mounting a difficult hill; and also notice that the farther forward
    we get, and the less the angle at the pedals between the saddle and the
    vertical, the less will be the pull on the handle-bar. (See early part
    of this chapter.)</p>

  <p>In this connection the very long saddles, largely adopted in America,
    are of great advantage, since, when not working hard, the rider can
    sit well back and then slide forward when occasion demands. What
    “Warrior” means by “greater power from muscular contraction” is rather
    ambiguous. I may admit that more power can be consumed when the saddle
    is back, but I deny that more effective power to turn the wheel can be
    maintained. The rider may get more exercise from “muscular contraction”
    than from the effect of his weight, but he will cover less distance
    with equal fatigue.</p>

  <p>As to “Semi-Racer,” his statement, that more ankle-motion is available
    when sitting back, is absurd. Will he not lose in “clawing” force below
    what he gains above?</p>

  <p>In my chapter on “Ankle-Motion” I would say that the wonderful power
    therein asserted as possible was attained by having the saddle well
    over the work. Before disposing finally of this digression, let me
    express my pleasure that these subjects are meeting with general and
    enlightened discussion. However much opinions may differ, I regret,
    as a loyal Yankee, that we in America have to depend so largely upon
    cross-water importations for the initiative; but it is hoped that such
    importations may always be on the free list, maugre the high-tariff
    proclivities of the writer and many others like him on this side.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span></p>

  <p>The next point of importance is the mechanical means whereby the
    rider transmits a revolving motion to the drive-wheel, and to lead
    up to this let us discuss the evolution from walking to riding. The
    actual development has been of a legitimate character; first, walking;
    second, walking with the trunk supported on rolling mechanism; third,
    propulsion by means of mechanical things like legs, the entire body
    supported upon rolling mechanism; fourth, propulsion and support all by
    means of, and upon, rolling mechanism.</p>

    <figcaption>The Dennis Johnson wheel.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>The early bicycle, such as that of Dennis Johnson, patented in
    England, No. 4321, 1818, did not support the rider entirely free
    from the ground. It consisted in a pair of wheels placed under him,
    constituting a sort of third or rolling leg, the feet, though not for
    support, still touching the ground. This machine is a fair sample of an
    intermediate stage between the era of oscillating devices subjoined to
    the trunk by nature—to wit, the legs—and that of the present cycle. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
    the Johnson machine the legs are used for projectile force only, and
    serve as a motor, the weight of the body being supported on rolling
    mechanism as aforesaid; hence it was a more natural and palpable
    sequence to walking than other prior contrivances in which the rider
    was raised upon a platform such as shown in the machine of Bolton,
    patented in the United States, September 29, 1804.</p>

    <figcaption>The Bolton machine.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>The Bolton and similar machines really belong to a different class
    from that of Johnson, but if we confine ourselves to our bicycle or
    balancing-machine, thus throwing out the Bolton class, the development
    from the leg to the wheel method proceeded in order, for we have next
    the Lallement crank-wheel, United States patent, November 20, 1866,
    which represents substantially the present single-track type.</p>

  <p>One illustrious gentleman, Croft by name, patented a machine in the
    United States, August 21, 1877.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span></p>

  <figure class="figcenter illowp90" id="i_038">
    <img src="images/i_038.jpg" alt="">
    <figcaption>The Croft machine.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>In the Croft machine a pair of bars held in the hands are used with
    which to propel by pushing against the ground, instead of using the
    legs as in the Johnson. By supporting the body entirely free from the
    roadway, Croft takes a step in advance of Johnson, but he still retains
    his propulsive power by means of oscillating devices having contact
    with the ground, and in this respect might be said to use a pair of
    mechanical legs. He combined a walking method with that of rolling, as
    was the case with Johnson and Baron Draise, but he seemed to think a
    mechanical extension to the arms a better medium through which to pass
    his energy than nature’s own devices for that purpose. Quite a number
    of inventors have gone astray on this question of the power of the arms
    in these manumotors. No doubt the arms could be made to help, but our
    present physical development suggests the legs as better; especially
    if one or the other plan is to be used alone. True, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span> Croft machine
    could use the entire body, as in the case of a man shoving a flat-boat
    or scow upon the water, but the inventor’s engraving does not show
    any such effort as necessary. What a pity that we did not have a
    single-track machine, propelled by the Croft process, between the
    time of Johnson and Lallement; how nicely it would have helped us out
    in our chronological development. We of the wheeling fraternity may,
    however, take a crumb of comfort from the fact that the two bicycles,
    or balancing machines, did make their appearance in respectful logical
    order.</p>

  <p>In naming the Bolton, Johnson, Lallement, and Croft machines, I have
    not taken the trouble to ascertain whether they all were the very first
    machines of the kind in the art, nor would it matter whether they were
    or not, unless it could be shown that others were of equal prominence.
    We should not recognize mere vagaries as an advance in the art: the
    above gentlemen patented their machines, and it is therefore reasonable
    to suppose that they were real workers, and not simply chimerical
    characters flitting about in the minds of recent explorers. The famous
    Draisaine is worthy of mention, but our man Dennis will answer all
    purposes of illustration. Galvin Dalzell is now reputed to have been
    the first to raise himself from the ground on a single-track machine,
    and back as far as 1693 one Ozanam, a Frenchman, is said to have made a
    four-wheeled vehicle of the Bolton type, but driven by the legs.</p>

  <p>Blanchard, about 1780, did some work in connection with the subject,
    and one Nicephore Niepse, we are told, made a machine of the Johnson
    type about the year 1815. For further information on this subject,
    see “Sewing-Machine and Cycle News,” in <cite>Wheelman’s Gazette</cite>,
    September, 1888.</p>

  <p>In quite a recent edition of <cite>The Wheel</cite> the editor gives us a
    little foretaste of a book to which we look forward with interest. In
    it he mentions improvements<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span> by Gompertz in 1821, Mareschal, Woirin, and
    Leconde as having worked on cranks in 1865, and David Santon as having
    brought a wheel to America in 1876.</p>

  <p>L. F. A. Reviere, of England, is said to have made the large front
    and small rear wheel; C. K. Bradford, of America, the rubber tire; E.
    A. Gilman, of England, anti-friction bearings, and A. D. Chandler, of
    Boston, is mentioned as an importer and rider of 1877.</p>

  <div class="subheadc" id="CONNECTING_LINK">THE CONNECTING LINK BETWEEN THE LEGS OF NATURE AND THE WHEEL OF
    MECHANICS.</div>

  <p>We now proceed to compare the different modes which have been devised
    to transmit power from the rider to revolve the wheel; of these there
    are two principal classes, the simple crank and the lever and clutch.
    These devices or connecting links relate to the motion of the legs as
    well as to the power transmitted through them. It is not necessary
    to treat of the horizontal motion of the limbs, as it is of little
    consequence provided the rider remains substantially over the work.
    Power is applied mainly through the vertical resultant, and the
    consequent fatigue is the effect of the amount of energy given out
    in a vertical direction. Crank riders acquire a horizontal power, or
    resultant force, by what we call ankle-motion, which has, to quite an
    appreciable extent, overcome the most serious inherent defect of the
    crank device; without this force the dead centre appertaining to the
    crank, in which the vertical resultant has no power to turn the wheel,
    would have made it a prey to the champions of other contrivances.</p>

  <p>The above remarks in regard to horizontal motion and resultant force
    apply equally well if the rider is not over the work, except in that
    the phraseology would be different. A man in straightening out his leg
    can apply power in a certain direction or in a certain line; now, if he
    is not over the work, this will not be a vertical line; hence the term
    horizontal motion would have to be called motion at right angles to the
    line of transmission of power.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span></p>

  <p>The importance of the dead centre is too great to be passed over
    without some further discussion. It would be a source of great
    satisfaction if a general conclusion could be reached in this crank
    versus lever and clutch controversy, but aside from the difficulty of
    drawing our conclusion there is a lack of a specific hypothesis in
    regard to an important element of the problem,—to wit, that as to the
    nature of the road and other resistance and consequent speed attainable
    or usually desirable. There is little doubt but that, so far as present
    developments show, the crank machine has excelled upon a smooth road
    and at high speed; yet this very fact leads us to suspect that perhaps
    for rough roads and at slow speed it might be objectionable, for it
    is easy to see that all questions of dead centres would eliminate
    themselves at high speed. Taking a steam-engine, of the crank and
    pitman type, for example, there is no trouble so long as speed is kept
    up, but it is well known that a certain velocity must be maintained
    or the crank will stop at the dead centre, even when provided with a
    heavy fly-wheel. Now, in a bicycle there is practically no fly-wheel at
    all, and, to pursue the comparison still further, we know that if the
    fly-wheel of an engine were removed great trouble would ensue; still it
    might be possible to keep running if the speed were great enough. It is
    evident, from common observation, that for intermitting slow and high
    speeds an engine, or any other machine, constructed without a fly-wheel
    must be provided with some means for continuing the power or carrying
    it over what would otherwise be dead centres. Multiple cylinders and
    rotary engines are made to serve this purpose.</p>

  <p>The commonly accepted idea that a cycle for racing purposes upon
    a smooth road is a certain guide as to the requirements under other
    conditions is therefore hardly justifiable. For best results the
    form of mechanism used as the connecting link between the legs of
    nature and the wheel of mechanics must be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span> determined, or at least be
    modified, by the conditions under which we intend to work. This problem
    is not at all confined to the art of cycling, it appears in many
    departments of mechanics. The same question has been mooted in respect
    to sewing-machines, and non-dead-centre attachments have been made
    and used upon them, but naturally the demand was not urgent, as this
    machine comes within the realm of high-speed devices with fly-wheel
    and evenly-running resistance. In scroll sawing by foot-power and in
    portable forges, non-dead-centre clutches are used with great effect.
    Hence our general mechanical experience makes it safe to say that such
    modes of continuous application of power have valuable uses applicable
    to this problem. It is not attempted to set up a definite unequivocal
    comparison or dictum in this matter as applied to cycles, for it is
    the desire of the writer and his right to make conclusions comparable
    only to the proofs recognized in practice, which in this case, in the
    cycle art, appear to be in favor of the crank machine. However, the
    writer’s opinion, based upon his theory and individual experience, is
    that we have more to fear from the weight, complication, and friction
    of parts in the lever and clutch than from the inherent principle of
    transmitting power upon which it works, and that some non-dead-centre
    device will finally prevail in the best all-around road cycles, if it
    can be relieved of purely mechanical objections which somehow seem
    to be naturally coupled with it. If the writer’s conclusion in this
    respect is tenable, the induction would follow that such a system, or
    connecting link, forms the most economical mode of applying power. The
    body can stand a steady, even pull upon its energy better than uneven
    intermitting jerks, and I feel sure new riders who have not acquired
    the ankle-action on the crank cycle will agree in this. This theory
    will apply to hill-climbing, in which lever and clutch machines have
    made so enviable a reputation. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span> rider has in clutch machines an
    even, steady resistance during the entire downward thrust, and he does
    not have to get all his power doubled up into a few inches of motion.</p>

  <p>The two principal classes of connecting links, the crank and ordinary
    form of lever and clutch, need no explanation or discussion beyond
    their fundamental characteristics, but there are several combinations
    of lever and crank which are of interest and properly come under the
    head of modifications of the crank. These modifications are numerous
    in the market, and there exists cardinal distinctions between them. We
    annex diagrams of five distinct types which fall into two groups, the
    first group being a combination of lever and crank, in which the foot
    has an oval motion, as shown by Figs. <a href="#i_044a">1</a>, <a href="#i_044b">2</a>, and <a href="#i_045a">3</a>, the arrows showing

  </div>

  <p>The second distinctive arrangement of lever and crank is where the
    lever is pivoted so as to return over the same track in which it
    descends, as shown in Figs. <a href="#i_045b">4</a> and <a href="#i_045c">5</a>. The first group, with its oval
    motion, has a decided advantage in regard to dead centre or continuous
    power; since by an ankle-motion the rider can transmit some power in a
    circular direction to the crank; that is to say, he can actually push
    to some extent in a forward horizontal direction. But it will be seen
    that the pivotal connection shown in Figs. <a href="#i_045b">4</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span> and <a href="#i_045c">5</a> does not allow of
    any such possibility; the rider must have momentum enough to throw the
    cranks over the dead centre or he is lost. In <a href="#i_045b">Fig. 4</a>, which represents
    a form of pivoted treadle used on a reputable make of front-driving
    machine, it will be noticed that the rider has less than one-half of
    the revolution of the crank in which any power can be transmitted at
    all, which becomes apparent in observing a pedal in such devices while
    in motion, from the fact that it descends more rapidly than it ascends,
    thus giving the rider less than half the time in which he can transmit
    any power. We are now speaking of one side only of the machine; taking
    both sides together, there are two short arcs of a circle in which
    there can be no propulsive power transmitted to the wheel on either
    side. <a href="#i_046">Fig. 6</a> illustrates this as follows:</p>

  <figure class="figleft illowp47" id="i_046">
    <figcaption><span class="smcap">Fig. 6.</span></figcaption>
    <img src="images/i_046.jpg" alt="">
  </figure>

  <p>In the descent of the lever from <i>b</i> to <i>c</i> the power will
    only be transmitted through the arc between <i>d</i> and <i>e</i>;
    taking an equal arc from <i>f</i> to <i>g</i> for the power given on
    the other side, we have the two small arcs <i>f d</i> and <i>g e</i>,
    all of whose points are dead points, and we might say we have a dead
    line. Upon the other hand, if the machine happens to be driven in the
    opposite direction from that of which we have been speaking, or, in
    other words, if the pedal is in advance of instead of in the rear of
    the driving-axle, as seen in <a href="#i_045c">Fig. 5</a>, we have an advantage, since the
    arcs <i>f d</i> and <i>g e</i> would represent arcs in which the rider
    has power on both treadles instead of on neither, and it might be said
    that, instead of having an arc of dead centre or no power, we have
    considerably less than no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span> dead centre at all. The lever and crank, <a href="#i_045b">Fig.
    5</a>, is a device used on some rear-driving machines,—the pedal descends
    slowly and ascends rapidly; certainly a desirable arrangement. That
    is to say, if the arc <i>d e</i> raises and <i>d f g e</i> lowers the
    pedal, it will then raise quickly and lower slowly; whereas, if <i>d
    e</i> lowers and <i>d f g e</i> raises the pedal, it will raise slowly
    and lower quickly.</p>

  <p>The study of wheels in the market made with front-driving mechanism, on
    the plan of <a href="#i_045b">Fig. 4</a>, suggests an incontrovertible argument in favor of
    getting over the work, in spite of the difficulty noticed in respect
    to dead centres; such machines actually have a creditable reputation
    as powerful hill-climbers and rough-road machines, which can only be
    explained on the theory that the vertical application of power more
    than makes up the deficiency caused by the arc of no power at all.</p>

  <p>In speaking of the second group, Figs. <a href="#i_045b">4</a> and <a href="#i_045c">5</a>, it must be understood
    that the matter of driving from either the front or the rear wheel has
    nothing to do with the principle, except in so far as it regulates the
    arrangement of the pedal and the direction of translation appertaining
    thereto. The difference in principle depends on whether the driving or
    the returning arc of the crank is towards or farther from the pedal.
    It strikes me that the style of lever and crank of the first group is
    a kind of cross between the direct crank and the pivoted lever and
    crank of Group II., and especially of <a href="#i_045b">Fig. 4</a> of that group, since it
    possesses some of the advantages and some of the objections found in
    both.</p>

  <p>I find from observations, which will be spoken of later, that the
    ankle-power in the direct crank is very considerable, and that it is
    diminished in the oval-motion lever, Group I., and that it disappears
    absolutely in the pivoted lever, Group II. These facts are really
    evident, but as they came within the domain of other experiment, I
    merely state the result.</p>

    driving mechanism, the road surface, and other conditions control the
    application of power is a curious study. In connection with it I have
    made an instrument to illustrate the same graphically, which, for the
    sake of a name, we will call the “Cyclograph,” an engraving of which
    will be found below.</p>

    <figcaption>The Cyclograph.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>A frame, <i>A A</i>, is provided with means to attach it to the pedal
    of any machine. A table, <i>B</i>, supported by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span> springs, <i>E</i>,
    <i>E</i>, has a vertical movement through the frame <i>A A</i>, and
    carries a marker, <i>C</i>. The frame carries a drum, <i>D</i>,
    containing within it mechanism which causes it to revolve regularly
    upon its axis. The cylindrical surface of this drum, <i>D</i>, is
    wrapped with a slip of registering paper removable at will. When we
    wish to take the total foot-pressure, the cyclograph is placed upon
    the pedal and the foot upon the table. The drum having been wound and
    supplied with the registering slip, and the marker <i>C</i> with a
    pencil bearing against the slip, we are ready to throw the trigger and
    start the drum, by means of a string attached to the trigger, which is
    held by the rider so that he can start the apparatus at just such time
    as he desires a record of the pressure.</p>

  <p>The following are a few sample sections cut from registering slips
    illustrating some of the points discovered in these experiments. Only
    a few strokes of the crank or lever can be shown; it is evident that
    great space and expense of reproduction would be required to give the
    entire record for even a small part of a mile. It will be understood, I
    think, without further explanation, that these curves show the extent
    and variation of pressure of the foot upon the pedal in order to drive
    the respective machines under circumstances named and described by the
    figures and thereafter.</p>

  <p>A six-inch crank was used upon the machines in these experiments, and
    the lever action was such as to be comparable to a fifty-inch gear. The
    height of a point on the curve shows the extent of and variation in
    power upon the pedal, and the translation from left to right the time.
    In consequence of the limit of pressure occurring but once in each
    stroke, the number of undulations determines the speed, since it would
    show the number of strokes in a given time, and we know the number that
    make a mile.</p>

  <p>The number of pounds’ pressure at any point on a curve is shown by the
    figures upon the perpendicular line, as, for example, in <a href="#i_049a">No. 1</a> the apex
    of the curve just to the right of the scale is about even with the
    hundred-and-fifty-pound point; this pressure was maintained for a very
    short space of time, since the curve travels a very short distance to
    the right at this point; in other words, it is quite sharp at the top.</p>

  <p>Stronger springs were used on the Cyclograph in testing the safeties,
    as I found myself liable to compress them beyond their limit; hence
    the scales must be closely observed in making comparisons. Among
    the interesting results noticeable in these experiments I find, for
    instance, in Nos. <a href="#i_049b">3</a> and <a href="#i_050a">4</a>, an abnormal deviation in the height of the
    curves at the same speed upon the same track at nearly the same time,
    though running in opposite directions. Finding this strange difference
    of some fifty pounds in pressure, I noticed an almost imperceptible
    breeze against me in the one, and in my favor in the other, direction.</p>

  <p><a href="#i_051c">No. 12</a> illustrates how a hundred-and-fifty-pound man gets up a pressure
    of two hundred and forty pounds presumably by a ninety-pound pull on
    the handle-bar.</p>

  <p>In <a href="#i_050g">No. 9</a> we see how one hundred and fifty pounds pressure is applied
    in back-pedalling down a grade of one foot in twelve. That the curve
    would not be very regular is easily impressed upon the mind of the
    average rider.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span></p>

  <p>One part of curve (not shown), of peculiar contour, terminated
    experiment <a href="#i_050g">No. 9</a> at a rut a little farther down the hill, with dire
    results to the operator and provoking influence upon the running gear
    of the ’graph, which has been making some erratic curves of its own,
    now and then, ever since.</p>

  <p>Comparing Nos. <a href="#i_050c">5</a>, <a href="#i_051a">10</a>, and <a href="#i_051d">13</a>, the curve of the lever machine (13)
    indicates that, while pressure is not so great as in the others, it is
    held for a longer time, shown by the greater height and sharper tops to
    the curves of the crank machines.</p>

  <p>The short cross-lines about three-fourths up on the left sides of the
    undulations in Nos. <a href="#i_051a">10</a>, <a href="#i_051b">11</a>, and <a href="#i_051c">12</a> designate the points at which the
    crank crosses the perpendicular at the top. There is quite a pressure,
    and it is a little odd that it should be found at this point; it can
    only be attributed to ankle-action back of the natural dead centre.</p>

  <p>In <a href="#i_050d">No. 6</a>, and to some extent in all the others, observe the jagged
    appearance in the general advance of the curves, which must be due
    to vibration: these results were all obtained upon tolerably smooth
    roads, mostly in Druid Hill Park, Baltimore. <a href="#i_050d">No. 6</a> was taken upon a
    road perhaps a little rougher than the track around the lake, but still
    upon an unusually smooth surface, and it was a surprise, not to say
    an alarming discovery, that this vibration should occur under such
    circumstances.</p>

  <p>The lake track, upon which results <a href="#i_049b">2</a> and <a href="#i_050a">3</a> were found, was in perfect
    condition, smooth as a surface-plate, and without the customary
    sprinkling of pebbles so common when dry weather has loosed the
    settings of these tiny obstructions and suffered them to roll out upon
    the roadway; yet these figures show the saw-teeth, and I have been
    unable to find a road smooth enough, or jointed machine frames and
    springs good enough, to make unwavering symmetrical lines. These little
    deviations in the curves always seem to show themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span> to the extent
    of several pounds in height in spite of all alleviating conditions,
    suggesting that we have much to strive for in the construction of the
    ideal wheel free from all concussion. In order to judge accurately
    of the total amount of power to turn the wheel, we have to consider
    the register of both pedals superposed, as in <a href="#i_050f">No. 8</a>, but the curve
    made upon one generally answers all purposes. The possibilities in
    this study are unlimited, and, with a perfectly-accurate instrument,
    it strikes me, the results of much more definite bearing than those
    acquired in the silly practice of testing machines by the strength of
    men.</p>

  <p>I have refrained from giving any tests as to the comparative
    power required to drive machines of the same type and of different
    manufacture, differences being liable to result from a bad condition
    of the machine, such as the want of oil, or from happening to get
    hold of an unusually bad sample, making the liability to do injustice
    too great. The writer does not feel himself called upon to judge of
    or express differences in quality of workmanship in general, if for
    no other reason than that by the time the matter goes to press, such
    merits or defects as he might have discovered may change. Workmanship
    does change, principles never can; and, what is more, the hypotheses
    and conclusions in regard to principles, treated of in this or any
    other book, are always open to contradiction; if injustice is done
    to any maker of wares in a matter of principle, said maker always
    has a remedy in defence, and if he can disprove assertions made his
    justification is complete, whereas if a mistake of fact is recorded,
    such as the operation of a certain machine, and the machine upon which
    the alleged fact is based happens to disappear, the party interested
    is denied a just remedy. There are of course certain criteria of good
    workmanship, and the same should be touched upon in order to teach the
    reader how to judge of it; but beyond this no writer should be allowed
    to go,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span> unless at least he has been paid for advertising competing wares
    at regular rates.</p>

  <p>The cyclograph attached to the revolving pedal shows the total amount
    of pressure required to do a certain work on a machine; but if it is
    desired to ascertain the track resistance or the friction of parts
    alone, it is necessary to so place the instrument as to register the
    tangential resultant in turning the crank, taking no note of any power
    thrown away by indirect application; that is, if we wish to register
    the circular or tangential resultant, the cyclograph is attached by
    its frame rigidly to the crank or lever of a cycle, and the revolving
    pedal, which has been detached, is hung upon the spring platform. This
    last arrangement is used in experimenting to ascertain the extra power
    available by ankle-motion, as will be shown hereafter.</p>

  <h3>ANKLE-MOTION AS SHOWN BY THE CYCLOGRAPH.</h3>

  <p>Throughout this work a slight tendency to urge the element of dead
    centre as against the crank-cycle may have been discovered. Makers
    and riders who find fault with this apparent praise of lever and
    non-dead-centre devices can derive considerable comfort by the study
    of ankle-motion. No better introduction to our diagrams, showing the
    possibilities arising therefrom, can be given than the following
    extract from the <cite>Irish Cyclist</cite>, via <cite>The Bicycling News and
    Wheelman’s Gazette</cite>:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="center">“ANKLE-ACTION.</p>

    <p>“Among the many thousands of riders in this country, says the
      <cite>Irish Cyclist</cite>, very few have any desire to improve their
      style or realize for a moment the vast importance of correct
      ankle-motion. You meet a rider plodding along, working his legs
      like pistons, with a heavy, lifeless motion. Remonstrate with him,
      and see what he will say: ‘Oh, he can go well enough; he does not
      believe ankle-action makes such a difference, and he does not want
      to “scorch” in any case.’ Now, we want our readers to grasp these
      facts. Any rider can acquire a tolerable ankle-action by careful
      practice, and the acquisition of such will increase his power by
      nearly one-fourth, and will enable him to ride hills<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span> never before
      attempted, and to keep up a better pace at the expense of the
      same amount of energy. This being so, the acquisition of such art
      should be a <i lang="la">sine quâ non</i> to every rider. That it is so can
      very easily be proved. In following the pedal the foot describes
      a complete circle. Suppose the circle to be divided into eight
      segments, taken in order from the highest point.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> With a rider
      who does not use his ankles, force is applicable only through
      segments 1, 2, 3, 4, and in segments 1 and 4, the force not being
      applied at right angles to the end of the crank, a large proportion
      is wasted, and consequently it is only thoroughly effective
      through segments 2 and 3, or during one-fourth of the revolution.
      The rider who has mastered the mysteries of ankle-action will
      drop his heel as the pedal approaches the highest point, and he
      can apply a certain amount of force through segment 8. After
      passing the so-called dead point, his heel being still dropped,
      the force is applied at right angles to the crank, or nearly so,
      and consequently he can utilize his full power through segment
      1. By rapidly straightening the ankle when entering segment 2 an
      additional impetus is imparted, and, as before, full power can be
      applied through segments 2 and 3. Entering segment 4, the heel
      should be raised and the pedal clawed backward, and this clawing
      action will enable the rider to work past the dead point and well
      through segment 5. Consequently, the man who rides with his ankles
      stiff can only work through segments 1, 2, 3, 4, or half the whole
      circumference, and his work is thoroughly effective only through
      segments 2 and 3, or one-fourth the circumference, whereas the
      man who utilizes his ankles can work through segments 8, 1, 2, 3,
      4, and 5, or two-thirds the whole circumference, and his work is
      thoroughly effective through segments 1, 2, 3, and 4, or one-half
      the whole circumference. The advantage gained in the latter case
      is self-evident. The acquisition of the art is often tedious and
      troublesome, but if cyclists only knew the enormous increase of
      power which results they would not be content until they had
      mastered it. From the cycling volume of the Badminton Series,
      written by Lord Bury and G. Lacy Hillier, we take the following
      instructions:</p>

    <p>“‘Seated either on a bicycle slung so that the wheel may revolve,
      or upon a home-trainer, the beginner should raise the pedal to
      its highest point, and then, steadying the wheel with the brake,
      place his foot upon the pedal, carefully fitting the slots in his
      shoes into their places, and seeing in any case that the foot is
      straight. Then, using the thigh muscle for the most part, let him
      thrust the foot (and pedal) forward in a horizontal direction;
      in fact, a sort of sharp forward kick, having the heel dropped
      as low as possible, the toes well up, and the foot firmly set on
      the pedal, which will be at an angle. This should be practised
      carefully with the brake slightly on, and for this purpose, though
      a bicycle may be used, a tricycle will be found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span> much handier. If
      no home-trainer is available, the brake can be put slightly on
      by means of a piece of string or strap to the lever, tied to any
      convenient point, and the novice can spend a few minutes daily
      practising this exercise; in carrying out which programme the
      left foot should at first be used more than the right. As soon
      as the usual awkwardness of the ankle-joint has been worked off
      this action will be found remarkably effective in starting the
      machine; after a time the ankle muscles, and those of the calf,
      will become stronger, and a sharp straightening of the ankle, as
      the pedal passes through segments 1 and 2, will materially aid the
      propulsion of the machine. This straightening of the ankle will be
      continued until the foot is brought into a position at right angles
      to the leg, the muscular effort of which should now have by equal
      gradations become directly downward. The pedal will now assume a
      horizontal position, and the power of the leg with the weight of
      the body and the pull of the arms will all be exerted to force it
      downward; at this point the crank throw is in the most effective
      position, and the hardest work is put in. When the pedal begins to
      follow a backward course, the ankle-action becomes of the greatest
      value. The toe is gradually dropped, and the heel raised as the
      pedal gets nearer and nearer to the lowest point, the action having
      at length reached the backward or “clawing” stage. To secure the
      full advantage of ankle-work, this “<em>clawing</em>” action must be
      very carefully practised; the toes should be sharply pressed upon
      the sole of the shoe as if they were trying to grasp something,
      whilst the ankle should be straightened as much as possible, the
      foot being almost in a line with the leg, the calf muscles being
      strongly retracted, and the backward pull (which of course requires
      fitted shoes) can be made practically effective through segment 5,
      and also of service well into segment 6. The ineffective portion
      which exists on either side is soon reduced to a very small part
      of the circle, for as soon as segment 7 is entered upon the heel
      should be sharply dropped, and an upward and forward kick or
      thrust, as described in the directions for the first position,
      will lift the pedal forward and upward through segment 8, when, of
      course, the whole series of actions will be repeated.’—<cite>Bicycling
      News.</cite>”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Using the arrangement of cyclograph spoken of, by which ankle-motion
    may be shown, I find that I can begin to get a tangential resultant
    force on each crank at an angle of eighteen degrees back of the
    vertical line through the axle of the drive-wheel, beginning at
    <i>d</i> and ending at <i>e</i>, <a href="#i_058">Fig. 1</a>,—in all, thirty-six degrees
    over a half-circle on each crank.</p>

  <figure class="figleft illowp54" id="i_058">
    <figcaption class="smcap">Fig. 1.</figcaption>
    <img src="images/i_058.jpg" alt="">
    <div>Ankle-power.</div>
  </figure>

  <p>The diagram shows the sections 1 to 8, and also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span> gives an idea of the
    extra power. To see the direct circular resultant force to turn the
    wheel, imagine the length of a crank from <i>m</i> to <i>n</i> without
    ankle-motion and then <i>m n</i> plus <i>n o</i> for the length of the
    crank with ankle-motion added. I have been able at each of the points
    <i>a</i> and <i>i</i> to get thirty pounds when the crank crosses
    the vertical line at the top and bottom. Thus it is discovered that
    by means of this ankle-motion on both cranks simultaneously, I can
    get a force of sixty pounds in the direction to turn the wheel, at a
    time when absolute dead centre would otherwise occur, amounting to
    two-fifths of the maximum pressure resulting from my entire weight on
    one crank at the best possible point, directly out in front, going down.</p>

  <p>I have more than verified the results shown by the cyclograph by
    suspending a fifty-four-inch bicycle, with six-inch cranks, above the
    floor, placing myself in the saddle, and having an attendant attach
    a twenty-pound weight at a point on the rim, ninety degrees from the
    bottom. This weight I was able to raise at the dead-centre point of
    both cranks,—that is, vertically up and down,—which shows a real power
    at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span> pedals of ninety pounds, or forty-five pounds on each, and I do
    not suppose that I am by any means an expert in ankle-motion. The above
    ninety pounds is a much greater showing than I made on the cyclograph
    in actual running, but it is reasonably certain that, by practice, even
    such an amount could be obtained.</p>

  <p>In the case of no ankle-motion,—that is, with a direct downward
    pressure on the crank,—a tangential force in the direction available
    in turning the wheel begins as the crank crosses the vertical at the
    top, and then increases as the sine of the angle the crank makes with
    the vertical, until such angle reaches ninety degrees or extends out
    horizontally, after which the power decreases as the sine of the angle
    the crank makes with the vertical below the centre until the crank
    crosses at the bottom, at which point the power ceases.</p>

  <p>To represent this variation of power by actual length of
    lines, appended will be found a diagram, <a href="#i_060">Fig. 2</a>, showing the
    tangential resultant or force to turn the wheel, imparted by
    a one-hundred-and-fifty-pound man with and without the use of
    ankle-motion.</p>

  <p><i>A A</i> is a line showing the divisions of the angles through which
    the crank passes in its revolution around the axle. The line <i>a f
    i</i> is a sine curve.</p>

  <p>Using the middle section and beginning at the point <i>a</i>, which
    is that at which the crank crosses the vertical above the axle, making
    a zero angle therewith, we have a direct downward pressure and, without
    ankle-motion, zero power. Now, by means of ankle-motion on one crank at
    this point we get thirty pounds of power, represented by the length of
    the line from <i>a</i> to <i>b</i>; and by ankle-motion on both cranks
    we have sixty pounds, represented by the total length of the line from
    <i>a</i> to <i>c</i>. After the crank has advanced forward fifteen
    degrees, we have thirty-nine pounds of direct power (<i>m n</i>),
    and then adding the ankle-power of twenty-three pounds (<i>n o</i>),
    we have a total resultant of sixty-two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span> pounds, represented by the
    length of the next line (<i>m o</i>), and so on up, the direct power
    increasing and the ankle-power diminishing till we come to the top of
    the curve <i>f</i>, when we have one hundred and fifty pounds of direct
    power. Passing through the angle of ninety degrees, and now counting
    from the vertical below the axle, we decrease in power inversely as we
    increased before.</p>

  <p><a href="#i_058">Fig. 1</a> will show a little more graphically to the eyes of some casual
    readers how the power expands. Take <i>d a f i e</i> as the regular
    swing of the crank with no power at <i>a</i>, then <i>d b f h e</i> as
    the increase of power on one and the dotted lines <i>c</i> and <i>g</i>
    as the auxiliary ankle-power on the other crank added.</p>

  <div class="subheadc">BALANCING, AND SOME QUESTIONS OF POTENTIAL ENERGY—HILL-CLIMBING.</div>

  <p>It seems pertinent at this point to make some further distinction
    between two distinctive classes of road wheels. The conception in the
    mind of man of road carriages which require an element of balancing
    was a recent event in the development of vehicles in general, and the
    similarity of the words bicycle and tricycle, together with the fact
    that both are included in the generic term velocipede, has led many
    to overlook a distinction of balancing, which should class them under
    very different heads. Both are velocipedes if we mean machines run by
    foot-power; both are man-motors in the light that human force or energy
    actuates them; but the two-wheel single-track machine must employ a
    particular faculty on the part of the rider, not required in running
    one of stable equilibrium.</p>

  <p>It seems superfluous at this stage of development of the art to
    enlarge upon the fact that a bicycle has to be balanced by a particular
    action not required in any other form of carriage; but when inventors
    will keep on getting up means to lock the steering device, and riders
    will persist in reminding us that the steering head “moves too easily,”
    it is severely pertinent to remark that while a certain law of whirling
    bodies might show us that a wheel will not fall over quite so quickly
    when rolling as when standing still, yet it is not this law so much as
    the action of steering that differentiates the bicycle, or single-track
    carriage, from other machines. The action of the handle-bar while in
    motion does substantially, in balancing the bicycle,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span> what you would do
    if you were balancing a cane vertically on the end of your nose: if the
    cane starts to fall, you run in that direction with your nose till you
    get under the centre of gravity again. But the bicycle can only fall
    sideways, so, when it tends to fall in that way, or when the centre of
    gravity gets to one side of the vertical line from the point of support
    on the ground, you cannot run directly sideways with the support as you
    would in the cane illustration, but you can run indirectly sideways,
    nevertheless, with the point of support, the only difference being that
    you must run considerably forward at the same time in order to shift
    the lower extremity, or point of contact and support, in that direction.</p>

  <p>After considerable discussion of this apparently simple subject with
    eminent gentlemen well qualified to speak on such topics, the following
    appeals to my mind as a more definite and complete explanation than
    that given in the nose and cane case, bringing in an element of the
    problem omitted above, to wit: in running the point of support of
    contact across and under, as it approaches the vertical plane of
    gravity and general forward momentum, the steering wheel lies slightly
    across this plane, and its own plane is still out of vertical, leaning
    a little, as it did before, with the centre of gravity back of the
    point of support; the forward momentum then throws the entire system
    upright. In rapid running this momentum does a large proportion of the
    work, and it has been vigorously maintained that all balancing is due
    to this element; for small motions, however, the cane explanation is
    quite sufficient.</p>

  <p>The foregoing explanation of uprighting the bicycle is, to my mind,
    almost <em>entirely</em> independent of any law of whirling bodies as
    generally understood.</p>

  <p>An article showing that this subject is not devoid of interest or
    obsolete is given below from the <cite>Bicycling World</cite>, in which I
    think the law of whirling bodies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span> will apply. “The Rochester wheelmen
    debated the question, ‘Why does a bicycle stand up while rolling and
    fall down as soon as onward motion ceases?’ The answer decided to be
    correct was, that ‘the bottom of the wheel can have no side motion
    because it rests on the ground; and since the bottom is constantly
    becoming the top and the top the bottom, if the upper part of the wheel
    gets any lateral motion, it is checked by being brought round upon
    the ground again before the motion has too much influence.’” I do not
    suppose this ingenious decision, rendered by the high and mighty Solons
    of the Rochester Club, was a serious one; however, we do find that just
    such logic is quite common.</p>

  <p>It is not plain whether the question discussed was that of a bicycle
    with or without a man upon it, but I take it to be the latter. Some of
    the gentlemen had no doubt noticed that to give the machine a shove
    it would keep upright for a longer time running than when standing
    unsupported. This is purely a case of the law that whirling things
    tend to keep their own plane, as illustrated in the gyroscope and
    the spinning top. In the running bicycle without a man upon it to
    constantly rectify its position, the principle is simply one of the
    parallelogram of rotations. If the wheel from any external force starts
    to fall over, or, in other words, to revolve around a horizontal
    line normal to its geometric axis, then, since the wheel is already
    revolving about its axis in the axle, the resultant of these two
    rotations will be a rotation about an axis inclined to the former axis
    of the wheel, which means that the wheel will begin to circle around
    a centre at some distance from the wheel on the side towards which
    it starts to fall. This new axis about which the wheel revolves will
    of course be in a plane perpendicular to the new plane of the wheel,
    and will be inclined downward from the horizontal plane through its
    centre, so that the wheel is no longer running in a vertical plane.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span> The
    rotation about the centre outside of the wheel, towards which centre
    the wheel leans, brings into play a centrifugal force acting to upright
    the wheel; that is, to bring it back to a vertical plane. Now, if the
    wheel be run along a straight groove, so that circling around a centre
    is prevented, then it will fall as quickly as when standing still; or
    if, in the bicycle, the steering-wheel be locked so that it will not
    turn out of the plane of the two wheels, there would be no uprighting
    resultant, and the machine, according to Newton’s law of independent
    forces, would fall.</p>

  <h3>SOME QUESTIONS OF POTENTIAL ENERGY, MOMENTUM, AND HILL-CLIMBING.</h3>

  <p>When a cyclist climbs a hill, he not only overcomes the friction which
    would be generated if he travelled over the same length of level road
    surface, but he ought to be supposed to establish a certain amount
    of potential energy, or energy against gravity, and therefore should
    lose none. Yet he does lose considerable somewhere or he would not
    dread the hilly road as he does. In this matter of potential energy in
    hill-climbing upon a cycle, the subject assumes a different aspect from
    that of rolling on or off obstructions, as in rough-road riding treated
    of elsewhere. In climbing a hill there is no loss of momentum from a
    too sudden change in its direction; the matter of inertia does not
    figure in the case in any way, and we have a mere question of the rise
    and fall of a weight under certain modifications, said weight being the
    rider and his machine, said rise the ascent of the hill, and the fall
    the descent thereof. In a purely physical sense, then, we store up a
    certain amount of energy, or, in other words, put so much energy to our
    credit as against gravity, and theoretically we have a right to expect
    to get the benefit of it.</p>

  <p>To illustrate this potential energy, suppose we place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span> a pulley at
    the top of a hill and a rider at each end of a rope running over the
    pulley, with one man at the bottom starting up and the other at the
    top starting down the same hill. The descent of one man would draw
    the other up, excepting that each would have to work only just enough
    to make up the loss from friction, as he would in case the road were
    level and of equal length. I have little doubt that in such a pulley
    arrangement there would be much less loss of power and energy than
    riders now experience in the actual practice of hill-climbing. To
    illustrate with one man how the potential energy should be returned and
    thereby benefit the rider, let us place him at the top of a hill at the
    bottom of which another hill of the same height begins, whence, by the
    acceleration of gravity, the rider ought to find himself at the bottom
    of the first hill with an amount of momentum acquired that would send
    him to the top of the next; in other words, we might naturally expect
    when we roll down one incline to roll just as far up another of the
    same grade, or of the same vertical height regardless of the grade, or
    else we should expect a return of the energy in sending us capering
    over a level road without further labor, until the kinetic energy is
    exhausted. We find, however, that such a desirable result does not
    appear, and we notice that, however long, beyond a certain limit, the
    hill may be, we have no more momentum or kinetic energy at our disposal
    than we would in the case of a shorter hill. To what can this loss be
    attributed? There is but one visible cause,—to wit, our work against
    the air.</p>

  <p>If all riding were done in a vacuum, we would more nearly get back our
    energy, but somehow or other the vacuum is generally in the rider and
    doesn’t count, so there is an end to that. The rider, then, loses the
    momentum he would acquire from gravity because the friction of the air
    is resisting his progress at the rate of, or according to, the square
    of his velocity. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span> order to store up all the energy in a falling body
    we must allow gravity to increase the velocity as the square root of
    the distance. But it is easily seen that a rate of speed will soon be
    reached such that the air by impact will entirely annul all increase
    of velocity, and therefore all of the momentum we can expect to have
    at the bottom of the hill is just that which was acquired at the time
    and point at which the impact of the air balanced the accelerating
    force of gravity. This will soon come to pass, even omitting other
    friction, which, in connection with hill-climbing, we can afford
    to omit with good reason, because we should expect to have that to
    overcome if the road were level. The mere difference in the length of
    the surface travelled over will not bother a cyclist if it be a good
    level road, so we must blame it all on the air; I see no other way
    out of it. No manner of springs or anti-vibrators will help us out of
    this difficulty. If our rider puts on the brake, then of course there
    is no question as to where the work goes; but, as we all know, with a
    safe machine and an expert rider this is not often done in an ordinary
    country.</p>

  <p>In defence of our theory of loss of energy on very long hills, observe
    the fact that a mere rolling road is not generally despised by the
    cyclist; in fact, many prefer it to a dead level, the writer being
    decidedly one of their number. The short intervals of labor and rest,
    the continual barter and sale with gravity, in the transfer of energy
    to and fro, is not by any means an uncomfortable diversion to either
    our minds or bodies; but when we come to suffer the usurious interest
    demanded by the action of the air against us, we simply draw the line,
    and go by another road, even though the surface thereof be not of the
    most inviting character.</p>

  <p>Some ingenious mechanics have devised mechanism whereby they propose
    to store up the power lost in the brake action; but it is doubtful if
    any riders would care for it after they become expert and daring, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
    they all do in course of time in spite of all admonition against undue
    risk.</p>

  <p>Speaking of potential energy and momentum, we naturally come upon the
    question of machine weight. It is a peculiar fact that the weight of
    the man does not form so important a part in the bicycle exercise as
    that of the machine, so that if a rider be heavier by twenty pounds
    than another, it will not generally count against him; but if that
    weight is in the machine, competition is out of the question. Nature
    seems to make up in muscle, or supply of energy in some way, for the
    extra weight in the man, but said nature is not so clever when this
    weight is outside of him.</p>

  <p>It is sometimes thought that a heavy man or a heavy machine will
    descend a hill faster than a lighter. This is not reasonable. The
    accelerating force of gravity being independent of the mass, the
    heavy system will have the same velocity at the bottom, and momentum
    being represented by mass, times velocity, the increased mass will
    increase the momentum; but the speed is the same: this extra momentum
    is required in raising the heavier system to the same height as the
    lighter. But even if the rider should get the benefit of all the energy
    he stores in climbing a hill, there is still an indisputable objection
    to a heavy wheel,—to wit, a man can labor long and continuously at a
    strain within reasonable limits, and can do a large amount of work
    thereby; but to strain the system beyond those limits, and attempt
    to store up too much energy in too short a space of time, is to make
    nature revolt, resist the imposition, and refuse to be appeased for
    some time to come and often not at all; in short, an overstrain is bad,
    and by a heavy machine, no matter what amount of energy you may store
    up at the top of the hill, if in so doing nature has been overtaxed,
    it will result disastrously. So we see that, outside of all mechanical
    questions of momentum and potential energy, there is a vital objection
    to heavy machines on purely physiological grounds.</p>

  <div class="subhead">COMPARISON OF THE CURVES OF TRANSLATION, IN MACHINES OF WHICH THE
    DIAMETERS OR COMBINATION OF WHEELS DIFFER, OF A POINT TAKEN IN THE
    SAME RELATIVE POSITION ON THE SEVERAL SADDLES—CONSEQUENT CONCUSSION
    AND EFFECT UPON MOMENTUM.</div>

  <p>In discussing this matter it has been taken for granted that the proper
    point upon which to base calculations is that point in the saddle at
    which the motion of the machine may be supposed to be transmitted to
    the rider; this happens to be very near the centre of gravity of the
    system, and is also quite near the centre of gravity of the man. The
    motion is of course partially transmitted to the rider at the pedals,
    but we will for the present waive that modification.</p>

  <p>Simple as the running of two wheels over an obstruction seems to be,
    there are some interesting points to study. It was a surprise to the
    writer, and it is his hope that it may be of interest to others, that
    the saddle, and of consequence the rider, actually goes backward at
    times when the wheels are running forward; as, for instance, when the
    machine rolls slowly from a four-inch obstacle, as shown by the curve
    of the point in the fifty-two-inch Ordinary given below, and also
    particularly in the advance upon the same of the Star rear-driver. This
    reversion of momentum sometimes results in a drop of the rear wheel,
    but it is always an actual reacting force in the front. We feel the
    curves very plainly on a rigid machine, but it is a satisfaction to
    know exactly what they are and what the springs must overcome.</p>

  <p>The diagrams show the paths of the point in the various machines
    passing over a four-inch obstruction; <i>F</i> designates the front
    and <i>R</i> the rear wheel, and the arrows indicate the direction
    of translation,—that is, the way the machine is running. The degrees
    designate the angle between lines from the drive-wheel axle, one
    extending vertically and the other through the saddle; sometimes
    also expressed in inches of horizontal distance between verticals
    through the rear axle and saddle. The heights or top points of the
    curves from the base line show the amount the machine is raised at
    the saddle as each wheel passes over the obstruction; these heights
    give inferentially the position of the saddle between the wheels,
    or, rather, between the vertical lines through the respective axles
    thereof, since the nearer over a wheel the saddle is placed the more
    it will be elevated when the wheel passes over the obstruction. Again,
    from the location of the saddle with reference to the axles we can
    determine the amount of weight carried by each wheel, the weight each
    carries being proportional to the respective distances from the saddle
    horizontally. The sum of the heights of the two curves from the general
    level will be the height of the obstacle.</p>

  <p>Theoretically there is no difference in the amount of work required to
    pass over an impediment, no matter where the saddle is placed, as the
    man must be raised in all to the height of the same, and it does not
    matter whether he is lifted up half way twice or all the way once in so
    far as the amount of labor is concerned. The man and the machine must
    be lifted up to a certain height in some way; as it happens, it is more
    comfortable to be lifted twice through half the distance than all at
    once; but this should not affect the actual work done nor the energy
    expended.</p>

  <p>Our scale in the study of this question is one-sixteenth of an inch to
    the inch; therefore in these diagrams one-eighth of an inch represents
    two inches in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span> the full-size bicycle. In this connection also it must
    be taken into consideration that the effect upon momentum is not shown
    entirely by the contour of these lines; the sudden stoppage or checking
    of the system is generally shown by a vertical tendency in the curve,
    but a very disagreeable shock to the body may occur and momentum be
    lost without any deviation in the curve whatever when, for instance,
    in the most pronounced case, the saddle goes straight back upon its
    course. This is shown by means of the short vertical or diverging lines
    upon the curves. These short lines show the distance forward the point
    in the saddle travels in proportion to the advance of the wheels in a
    forward direction in space; each short line indicates an advance of two
    inches in the wheels. When the lines are below the curve, the saddle
    has actually dropped backward,—that is, it has been directly reversed
    in its course.</p>

  <p>When the short lines upon the curve are close together, it shows that
    the saddle and rider are being checked proportionately as these lines
    are less than one-eighth of an inch apart. On the other hand, when the
    normal pace of the momentum of the heavier parts is slower than that of
    the wheels, it is shown by the lines being more than an eighth of an
    inch apart. In this case there is a tendency to increase the momentum
    instead of decreasing it,—a state of affairs not so much to be deplored
    if it were not evident that it is equally checked at some other point.</p>

  <p>We know, in practice with the Ordinary, that the loss of momentum by
    sudden checking can only happen to the full extent when the pace is
    reasonably slow; should the momentum be too great it will simply refuse
    to be interfered with in its forward course, and the rear wheel will
    leave the ground with a result and in a manner quite well known.</p>

  <p>In the safer forms of bicycles,—those from which a header is
    improbable,—without proper springs, the rider will simply slide forward
    on the saddle, causing considerable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span> loss of momentum besides that due
    to vibration, since he must afterwards slide himself back again.</p>

  <p>Referring to the diagrams, <a href="#i_070a">Fig. 1</a> shows the Ordinary bicycle with a
    fifty-two-inch front and an eighteen-inch rear wheel. The front wheel
    mounts the obstacle with some difficulty, the curve upward being rather
    sudden in its change of direction from the base line, thus showing that
    the momentum is checked very rapidly; see the short vertical lines upon
    the curves, which are about one-half the distance apart of those on the
    base line between the curves and at the ends. Also notice that <i>F</i>
    (the front wheel) carries three-fourths of the weight, one curve being
    about three times as high as the other.</p>

  <p>Particular attention is called to the easy and gradual curve shown
    by the mounting of the small rear wheel <i>R</i>; it would seem to
    show that the great clamor of theorists for large rear wheels in the
    Ordinary is somewhat unwarranted; the drop down and back in rolling off
    the obstacle will be seen to be quite sudden, but notice not very much
    more so than in <a href="#i_070b">Fig. 2</a>, which shows the Rational, so called, with a
    fifty-two-inch driver and twenty-four-inch rear wheel. The large rear
    wheel affects the drop to some extent, but in all obstacles under four
    inches in height there is no perceptible benefit derived, at least not
    such as to warrant the extra weight and disarrangement of the steering.</p>

  <p><a href="#i_070c">Fig. 3</a> shows a machine with a fifty-two-inch rear driver, <i>R</i>,
    and an eighteen-inch front steering wheel, <i>F</i>, with the saddle
    twenty degrees in front of the vertical line through the driving axle.
    The curves are just the reverse of the Ordinary; in the latter the
    quick drop, down and back, of the rear wheel in leaving is comparable
    to the backward thrust of the front wheel in <a href="#i_070c">Fig. 3</a> running upon
    the obstruction. No machine in the market at present makes exactly
    the curve of <a href="#i_070c">Fig. 3</a>; it is about that which the American Star would
    make with its saddle a little farther forward,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span> and that of a recent
    rear-driving crank machine called the “Eagle.”</p>

  <p><a href="#i_071a">Fig. 4</a> shows the American Star, as commonly seen, with a fifty-two-inch
    rear driver and the saddle directly over the driving axle. This
    curve shows no elevation of the saddle as the front wheel mounts the
    obstacle, but a radical check to the momentum is shown; observe the
    curve (<i>F</i>), and note that the saddle is forced back in the order
    of the small numerals, advancing to 1, going back to 2, then on to 3
    and 4, which shows that the momentum is not deviated up or down, but is
    directly reversed in its course.</p>

  <p><a href="#i_071b">Fig. 5</a> shows a new machine of the Star pattern, with twenty-four-inch
    front steerer, <i>F</i>, and a thirty-nine-inch rear driver, <i>R</i>.
    The check in the momentum is not so radical as that shown in <a href="#i_071a">Fig. 4</a>, as
    the front wheel mounts the obstacle. The one short line below the curve
    shows the backward thrust.</p>

  <p>The sudden check in striking an obstacle, with the machines last
    referred to, shows the necessity and enormous advantage of a forward
    give to the saddle support adopted in some of those patterns. This
    arrangement is not so necessary in the Ordinary, yet it would do no
    harm, for it will be seen that the large front wheel of the latter
    strikes the obstacle with quite a sudden upward curve and check in the
    momentum sufficient to justify its use.</p>

  <p>In the Star, Eagle, and such other types the man is raised upon the
    obstacle entirely by the large rear wheel, which carries nearly all of
    the weight, as shown by the height of the curve; it raises beautifully
    upon the obstruction with little or no check in the momentum, the
    diverging lines showing about the same distance apart as at the base.
    It has been thought to be an advantage to reduce the weight upon the
    front wheel, but the importance is very much exaggerated; it will
    reduce the impact in dropping down from an obstruction, and will thus
    cause less annoyance in rough-road riding;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span> still this does not alter
    the fact that the momentum in the man and part of the machine is not
    only stopped, but reversed backward, as shown in the diagrams. If
    the wheel were lifted entirely free from the ground before advancing
    upon the obstruction, it is obvious, then, that no harmful result
    would ensue, not so much because the jolt and impact in dropping off
    is obviated, but for the reason that the momentum forward is not
    interfered with. If the rider should run full force against a wall with
    his forward wheel, it would be of little consequence to him whether
    there was any weight upon it or not; it is not always a question of
    vertical disturbance or of the action of gravity that is of annoyance
    to the bicycle rider; it is sometimes better to have a heavy weight
    upon a wheel if it can be kept in contact with the obstruction, as, for
    instance, upon the front wheel of the Ordinary when it rolls off, as it
    will be seen that the curve shows a splendid contour by which to give a
    good pull on the machine.</p>

  <p><a href="#i_071c">Fig. 6</a> shows the Kangaroo type, with a forty-inch front driver and an
    eighteen-inch rear wheel; this curve presents very little change from
    that of the Ordinary.</p>

  <p><a href="#i_072a">Fig. 7</a> illustrates the Rover type, having two thirty-inch wheels with
    their centres forty-one inches apart, the saddle forty inches high and
    twelve inches in front of the vertical through the rear axle. The mere
    contour of the curve in the last figure mentioned would be somewhat
    misleading did the diverging lines not show that in the rolling off
    of the rear wheel the momentum is considerably checked,—that is, the
    saddle moves more slowly forward than the normal forward pace of the
    wheels, though there is no direct reversion of the momentum, as occurs
    in the Ordinary and some others.</p>

  <p>In this connection let me call particular attention to a cardinal
    distinction with reference to the action in rolling upon and from an
    obstruction. If the wheels<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span> in descending hold the man back in order
    to remain in contact and thus roll off, it will, of course, result
    in a check of momentum exactly equal to that which would occur in
    such advance upon an obstacle, as would be shown by a similar curve
    in the opposite direction; but, as a matter of fact, the momentum
    being a certain amount, the effect is to cause the wheel to leave the
    obstruction entirely and not roll, but jump off, which result causes
    a great loss of energy and is sure to occur in rapid running. In this
    case the forward momentum gets no benefit from the potential energy
    acquired in mounting the obstacle, which shows the great necessity of
    proper springs such as will enable a man to swing forward slightly
    without rigidly drawing the machine after him. The object of the
    springs in this connection should be to hold the wheel in contact and
    permit it to roll instead of forcing it to jump off; if it rolls and is
    not carried off by the force of momentum, the energy will be given out
    in driving the machine forward instead of being lost in the vibration
    caused by impact when the machine strikes the common level. That is
    to say, the machine should roll off, but not hold the man back in
    order to do so; by proper springs the wheels remain in contact, while
    the man goes on at the regular pace of momentum. The liability of the
    rear wheel to jump off is a serious difficulty in the present Rover
    type of rear-driver; there is no reversion of the momentum, nor such a
    tendency to drop perpendicularly, as in the Ordinary, yet it drops a
    greater distance and is charged with more weight. This objection cannot
    be entirely remedied by any springs we now have in use; it requires
    a lively vertical as well as a horizontal amplitude in the motion of
    the springs, and they should be placed at the hub of the rear wheel in
    a manner similar to those used of late in connection with the front
    wheel. It will be seen from the diagrams that the curves shown by the
    front wheels leaving the obstructions are never such as would show any
    liability<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span> to jump off; advancing <em>upon</em> the obstruction must, in
    them, be mostly provided for.</p>

  <p>In <a href="#i_072b">Fig. 8</a> we have a machine provided with a thirty-inch front and
    twenty-four-inch rear driving-wheel. This is a modification of the
    Rover type recently favored by some English makers. The drop of the
    rear wheel is more radical than that of a full thirty-inch.</p>

  <p>In <a href="#i_072c">Fig. 9</a> appears a Dennis Johnson machine, with two wheels of the
    same size, having the seat low down and exactly midway between them.
    This is perhaps the easiest riding contrivance in so far as vibration,
    jolt, and shock are concerned. Observe the equable motion it displays.
    This machine was patented in England, as spoken of in an early chapter,
    seventy years ago.</p>

  <p>It will be seen, from a general observation and study of all of the
    diagrams, that the best and most gradual curves are made by the front
    wheel in descending from, and by the rear wheel in advancing upon, the
    obstacle; hence it follows that the front wheel works against momentum
    more in ascending and the rear wheel more in descending.</p>

  <div class="subheadc">SPRINGS IN RELATION TO THE CURVES OF TRANSLATION, MOMENTUM, AND
    CONCUSSION.</div>

  <p>It was a pet scheme of the writer’s to treat of the matter of the
    annoyance to the rider resulting from a shock or jolt and change in
    momentum in the various styles of bicycles in a purely mathematical
    form, and to some extent it can be done; but it is found that so many
    considerations enter that the question becomes almost interminable.
    The aim was to find a formula with the sizes of wheels, distances
    between centres, and position of saddle as variables, which would,
    when applied, give us a result representing the sum total of annoyance
    felt by the rider in passing over an obstacle or any depression,
    rut, or ditch of given height or depth on any combination of wheels
    likely to be used in one machine. The difficulty in the question is in
    determining just what that annoyance results from or consists in; no
    doubt the initial impact, change of direction, and sudden reduction of
    momentum, and also the duration of the shock, all enter into the grand
    total.</p>

  <p>From a theoretical stand-point there need be no loss of power and
    consequently no annoyance in running over an obstacle, since all the
    momentum lost in a forward direction ought to be transmitted vertically
    in mounting the obstacle, thereby establishing a potential energy which
    would again be transformed into momentum forward as the wheel rolls
    down from the elevation. Neither should a rut have to be avoided,
    since by running into it we gain a momentum that should carry us out;
    hence, as per theory, the cycler should not worry about riding over
    rough roads, for in mounting each obstacle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span> he only loans a bit of
    power in going up, which will be returned to him in going down, and
    in running down into a rut momentum will be loaned to him sufficient
    to bring him out. But, alas! he does not fancy the thing; somehow he
    has a like prejudice against rough roads that he has to hills, and as
    this prejudice cannot arise from purely theoretical considerations, we
    must look for some violation of nature’s laws, or some cause why such
    laws are not directly applicable. In my judgment there is a reasonably
    definite connection between the annoyance felt by the cycler in riding
    over a rough road and the actual loss of energy, though not a similar
    one in all respects to that which applies in regard to hills. A shock
    produced by a sudden check or deviation of the momentum is not only
    hurtful in causing a direct loss of kinetic energy, which the rider has
    stored up and to regain which he must afterwards do work, but also in
    contusing and jarring the muscular system, which makes him less able to
    do the work. In so far as the machine is concerned, the loss of energy
    goes into vibration and into extra friction of the machine; we cannot
    see any other means by which it can escape; but as to the rider, while
    energy is of course similarly lost, the motive power is also interfered
    with. Now, the application I wish to make of this fact, <i>i.e.</i>,
    that the annoyance or shock felt by the rider in wheeling over rough
    roads is comparable to an actual loss of kinetic energy, as well as in
    addition thereto, is that the nearer we can approach to an even rolling
    motion affecting the rider least disastrously, the nearer we will come
    to a perfect road bicycle without loss of momentum. In other words, the
    dynamical and physiological considerations lead us to the same end,—to
    relieve the annoyance by means of proper springs, and to so distribute
    the inequalities of the momentum and modify the change in direction
    thereof as to minimize the loss of energy. From experiments tried with
    properly-constructed springs, I find<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span> that momentum can be diverted in
    striking the obstacle into its required new course, upward and forward,
    with very slight loss indeed, and that much waste of power in rolling
    off the obstacle can also be saved, the desired conditions and effect
    being as follows:</p>

  <p>The wheel strikes the obstacle, springs back a little, and begins to
    rise upon it; at the same time an upward thrust is given, additionally
    compressing the vertical components of the springs, the man going on
    forward at the usual pace of momentum and being gradually raised. When
    the top is reached and the wheel starts down, the weight of man and
    machine causes the wheel to spring forward a little at first, and then,
    when the weight would drop too slowly and the momentum would otherwise
    pull the wheel bodily off, the vertical spring, being compressed,
    will, by its quick action, together with the pressure backward of the
    horizontal spring against the obstruction, hold the wheel in contact
    and make it roll off. This action is reversed in the case of a rut, and
    is quite similar in either fore or hind wheel.</p>

  <p>The principle is to avoid a too sudden attack upon the inertia, to
    change the course of momentum gradually, and to avoid concussion
    against inelastic parts.</p>

  <p>The direct vertical amplitude in the springs of a cycle is of most
    benefit in regard to momentum in giving the vertical power time to act;
    that is, if the wheels are raised quickly the momentum is transmitted
    to and stored up in the springs and allowed to act gradually in
    raising all the parts without violent concussion or vibration and
    consequent loss of power. When the machine drops suddenly in descending
    from an obstacle the springs will act more quickly than gravity can
    overcome the inertia of the system, and the wheel will then remain in
    contact with the obstacle; that is to say, sufficient spring acting
    horizontally in the direction of the acquired momentum, together
    with the necessary amount of vertical spring, will store the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span> energy
    otherwise lost in riding suddenly upon an obstacle; said energy will
    then be given time to act and be utilized in raising the rider and such
    parts of the system which the springs control to a certain height,
    establishing a potential, which will be given out in increasing the
    forward momentum as the wheel rolls down to the common level.</p>

  <p>Springs having a horizontal movement relieving only the saddle can
    prevent loss of momentum in the man, but cannot prevent the weight of
    the machine from being thrown dead against the obstacle. This can only
    be remedied by elastic connections of a kind that prevent the shock
    from ever reaching the heavier parts, which condition would save almost
    the entire work lost against the obstacle.</p>

  <p>We see, then, that the subject of springs comprehends not only the
    question of comfort in regard to the shock sustained by the body,
    but also the most serious and interesting factor in relation to the
    economy of power; nor is this a theme at all confined to cycles; it
    has been egregiously overlooked by makers and riders of many other
    vehicles. No better illustration can be had of man’s selfishness, as
    against the brute creation, than the fact that now, in machines in
    which we have to pull our own load, we are just beginning to contrive
    and apply all possible means to prevent a loss of momentum, whereas
    in all our carriages drawn by horses we looked only to the ease and
    comfort of our bodies, and provided good springs with a vertical give
    for that especial purpose, having little care for any loss of power, to
    avoid which loss we should also use horizontal springs so placed as to
    relieve the entire weight of the heavy running gear, as well as that of
    the man, from forward concussion. I know full well, even then, that a
    horizontal spring has still some little to do with the ease of riding,
    but with a heavy conveyance the advantage to the rider is slight
    as compared with the advantage that it would be to the horse which
    furnishes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span> the power. The time will come when the evil will be remedied
    in general carriages, if only for the gain it will be to the comfort of
    the man. There would be little hope, indeed, if the poor horse were the
    only party interested, but when man is directly concerned we can expect
    more rapid development.</p>

  <p>When we start our machines for a run it is considerable work to get up
    an initial velocity or momentum; however, after that there should be
    only the friction of the machine within itself and upon the road to
    be overcome, together with the friction against the air; that is to
    say, if inequalities in the road could be run over without a loss of
    momentum being caused thereby, there would not be nearly so much work
    in travelling upon the cycle as is now necessarily required.</p>

  <p>The principal parts of the cycle should be as rigid and firm as
    possible, so as not to respond at random in vibration to every little
    shock they should chance to receive, for the spring or elasticity wants
    to be such as can be controlled,—that is, made to store energy in the
    right way and give it out at the proper time with a desired effect upon
    the momentum.</p>

  <p>It must be remembered in this connection that useful energy can be
    stored in the machine only in the plane of horizontal motion and
    gravity; in other words, vertically and horizontally. Any elasticity at
    an angle to this plane can only be of use in reducing the concussion
    upon the rider in a lateral direction; and since, upon a single-track
    machine, but little if any shock can occur in such direction, it should
    be seen to that no undue side motion is permitted.</p>

  <p>In order to fully comprehend the loss of power that it is possible
    to save by proper springs, observe as a particular case the annexed
    diagram showing two thirty-inch wheels arranged substantially as in the
    present rear-driving Safety.</p>

  <p>Let <i>c</i> be the centre of gravity, and let the line <i>c o</i>,
    drawn to the obstacle, pass through the centre of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span> front wheel and
    make an angle of forty-five degrees with the horizontal.</p>

  <figure class="figcenter illowp95" id="i_085">
    <img src="images/i_085.jpg" alt="">
    <figcaption>Rover momentum.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>The momentum <i>c l</i> is split up into two equal components, one
    acting in the direction <i>c o</i>, and the other in the direction <i>c
    k</i> perpendicular to <i>c o</i>, tending to turn the system about
    <i>o</i> as a centre. The numerical value of the <i>c k</i> component,
    calling <i>m</i> the momentum, is <span class="frac"><sup><i>m</i></sup><sub>√2</sub></span>, and its value in the
    forward direction <i>c o</i> is <span class="frac"><sup><i>m</i></sup><sub>√2</sub></span> cos 45°
    = <span class="frac"><sup><i>m</i></sup><sub>√2</sub></span> <span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><sub>√2</sub></span>
    = <span class="frac"><sup><i>m</i></sup><sub>2</sub></span>, which is the forward momentum retained, showing that in
    this case one-half of the forward momentum is saved and the other half
    lost.</p>

  <p>It is scarcely necessary to say that the use of an imaginary
    four-inch obstruction, in our study of momentum and concussion, is
    entirely arbitrary. Of course obstructions of all heights will evolve
    proportional results. This proportion would not, however, be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span> linear;
    the nearest we can come to it is to say that the annoyance begins with
    an obstruction of zero height, and increases about as a trigonometrical
    sine increases when the angle grows larger.</p>

  <p>It is evident that all this theory applied to one obstruction is simply
    repeated in a number of them, and a number of them make up a rough
    road, bearing in mind that a rut is but one form of an obstacle.</p>

  <p>Some makers of late seem to realize the importance of springs which
    will allow of a horizontal as well as a vertical motion, and have in
    them not only provided against the loss of momentum in the man, but
    also in the entire machine exclusive of the front wheel. This has
    apparently been done with another object in view,—<i>i.e.</i>, that of
    relieving the annoyance to the hands and arms by reducing the vibration
    in the handle-bar. This object, though worthy, is far short of the
    ideal. Such springs might properly be called storage springs or power
    economizers; they are, however, generally nominated Anti-Vibrators and
    Spring Forks.</p>

  <div class="subheadc">ANTI-VIBRATORS AND SPRING FORKS.</div>

  <p>The abstract terms of the heading have, so far, generally been applied
    to certain devices constituting an elastic connection between the
    standards of the wheels (1), or, more precisely, between the front
    fork and backbone. The more recent forms of anti-vibrators are (2)
    the spring hinge about midway in the rear frame, or backbone, of the
    machine; (3) the spring joints at the extremity of the front fork
    connecting with the forward wheel axle; (4) the spring fork proper,
    in which the extensions are either wholly or in part elastic. The
    last two are, to my mind, the most deserving of praise. In the first
    named above, the shock is mainly confined to the front half of the
    machine,—that is, to the front wheel, its fork, and handle-bar,—while
    in the last two the front wheel alone receives the concussion to
    the full extent, an intervening spring preventing the transmission
    of the shock to other parts of the system. When it comes to be
    fully appreciated by the fraternity that the shock sustained by the
    machine and rider is not only to be treated as a matter of comfort
    or discomfort, but that it has other very important claims to our
    consideration, we may expect it to be more fully discussed. Not that
    we care so much about the vibration loosening every joint, screw, and
    pin in the entire contrivance, which makes it worn out, so called,
    when it has scarcely begun to wear,—of course, in the general march of
    progress, we expect to remedy that also,—but it is the momentum we are
    most after. The writer has always been one who has had a constitutional
    aversion to working<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span> up a speed and then having it all knocked out by a
    stray stone.</p>

  <p>The difficulty experienced by inventors in the line of anti-vibrators
    appears to be, that while acquiring the desired elasticity in the
    proper direction an elasticity in other directions has followed,
    making the machine feel unsteady and capricious, especially in the
    steering. This undoubtedly valid difficulty in the way is worthy of
    careful consideration before accepting an anti-vibrator; in fact, the
    very end desired can easily be missed in an imperfect device, as it
    might, while holding momentum in one direction, lose it in another. I
    cannot better express my opinion as to the general requirement of a
    good anti-vibrator than to say, get plenty of spring, but acting in the
    plane of momentum and gravity, and get it as quickly as possible; that
    is, at the connection of the wheels with the forks, or at the outer
    end of the spokes if it can be done without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span> interfering with the rigid
    transmission of power to the driving-rim.</p>

  <figure class="figcenter illowp60" id="i_088">
    <img src="images/i_088.jpg" alt="">
    <figcaption>Recent American anti-vibrator.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>It is always difficult to apply any attachment to the driving-wheel
    of a machine; in the Ordinary it would be beneficial to attach an
    anti-vibrator to the forward wheel, but as a matter of construction it
    would be about as difficult to do this as it would be to attach it to
    the rear wheel of the Safety.</p>

  <p>We hope to see and may expect a number of devices to be offered by
    makers which will fulfil all requirements. Appended find a cut of one
    recently patented, of which I can speak with some confidence from
    having used a similar contrivance in experiments in this connection.</p>

  <p>The figure here, as in the patent, shows the connecting-rod swinging
    through an almost useless arc of action, but the general plan is good;
    not, however, as neat as some others.</p>

  <p>A great maker has of late, however, adopted a device which, to my mind,
    does <em>not</em> fulfil all of the requirements; it is still confined
    too much to a vertical action, and has really no horizontal amplitude
    unless the machine is ridden by a very heavy man, in which case the
    spring will assume a very abnormal position.</p>

  <p>Other makers have adopted the joint to the centre of the frame or
    backbone of the Safety type (No. 2 above), so constructed that the
    pedals are also provided with a vertical motion; this certainly
    helps to isolate the man from vertical concussion, and it is good;
    yet the horizontal give is lacking in these machines, and the front
    fork, together with the handle-bar, still receives a shock and loses
    in vibration. Later, an inventor has shown a new pedal in which,
    apparently, the rubber works upon a spring and has a vertical motion
    under the pressure of the foot. This is a deserving though a misguided
    effort. The connection of the man with the apparatus through which the
    power is transmitted to the machine should be as direct and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span> rigid as
    possible: all springs should be beyond this point. An elastic pedal
    is quite a different device from that named in the last preceding
    paragraph, in which the crank-shaft has a vertical motion and the
    “connecting-link,” together with the source of power (the man), are all
    rigidly and inelastically connected together, the whole, as a system,
    swinging vertically by a spring.</p>

  <p>An English firm has for several years had upon the market a machine
    which, from its external appearance, is all springs; the inventor
    thereof deserves greater credit than the success of the venture has
    awarded him. If in the early samples put upon the market the parts had
    not been so frail and the appearance so exceedingly homely, he might
    have fared better.</p>

  <p>Several premature freaks of advancement in this matter of springs have
    occurred, but the general progress has been quite logical. First, we
    had the saddle provided with a very feeble amount of elasticity, then
    an increased amount, until makers vied with each other in producing the
    best spring for the old Ordinary; then we had the spring connection
    between the front fork and backbone in the Safety, confining the shock
    to the forward half of the machine; and then came the spring fork
    isolating the entire system except the front wheel from the shock. So
    far the inventions have been practical and are in use. Next we have a
    worthy, but I fear impractical, inventor, who proposes springs between
    two outer rims of the wheel or substantially at the ends of the spokes,
    thereby confining the concussion to one rim of the front wheel in the
    manner shown in cut. (See English spring rim.)</p>

  <p>This appeared to be the ultimatum, but a shrewd American inventor has
    “gone him one better” and proposes to confine the shock and vertical
    thrust to a mere part of the rim. This invention was patented in the
    United States in 1889, and, if practical, would simply cause the
    wheel to roll over the obstruction almost as a man would step over in
    walking,—an ideal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span> state of affairs, to be sure! Such a wheel would not
    only aid man in his transmigration over smooth roads, as claimed for
    the solid wheel in the fore part of this book, but would be available
    on the cross-ties of the poorly-ballasted railroad; and let the wheel
    be but tall enough, and he may yet go over that old-time impediment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span> to
    cross-country locomotion, the rail fence, as unwittingly as though it
    had not been there at all.</p>

  <p>One of the grandest ideas in the way of anti-vibration is suggested by
    the following from the <cite>American Athlete</cite>:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“An inventor of Belfast, Ireland, has made what he calls a
      ‘Pneumatic Safety,’ the tires of which are two inches in diameter,
      and of <em>hollow</em> rubber, so that they contain air, which vastly
      increases their elasticity. The result is most favorably regarded
      by Irish wheelmen, and at the recent races at Belfast a rider on a
      ‘Pneumatic’ won all the four first prizes, the hollow rubber being
      described as phenomenally successful on the rough grass track.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>If the liability of cutting and collapsing were not so apparent in this
    device, I would be inclined to think it would have a great future.</p>

  <p>By way of conclusion of the foregoing chapters on curves, momentum,
    and springs, permit me to again call attention to the remarkable fact
    that a rear-driving Safety of absolutely rigid construction, striking
    an obstacle four inches high, loses one-half of its entire momentum and
    that of the rider. Think of it! Not that we often strike a four-inch
    obstruction, but that it does not take very many smaller to make one.
    Thus we are continually wasting strength when there is really no
    substantial necessity or occasion for it, and the writer, for one,
    feels ready to maintain that even double the weight (harmful as extra
    weight always is) in a machine is justifiable if in so increasing the
    weight we can do away with this most potent source of loss of energy.
    The bicycle, or single-track machine, too, affords an unusual chance
    for proper manipulation of momentum, and the rear-driver a special
    opportunity for the attachment of proper springs. In a two-track
    machine, on the other hand, we are compelled to supply springs with
    lateral motion as a necessary appliance for the comfort of the rider,
    which lateral motion results in loss of momentum and kinetic energy,
    whereas in the bicycle our comfort and energy are all confined to one
    plane; so that all we want now is to have our springs adroitly and
    amply applied to operate in this plane and no other, and we shall then
    find that we invariably save our momentum, preserve our comfort, and
    retain our strength. It will be a long time before we can expect to
    realize our dream of perfection in easy riding, or to find cyclers
    hunting for the rough roads; nor do we expect to see them peering
    eagerly forward through the misty morning, greeting the dawning
    obstacle as glad tidings of “Land ho!” but we do expect very soon to
    see the discomfort and loss of power now encountered in a great measure
    overcome. If some one will only get us over the sandy places as nicely
    as we can reasonably expect, in the future, to glide over the rough
    places, then we will all be happy.</p>

  <div class="subheadc">SADDLES AND SPRINGS IN RELATION TO ANATOMY AND HEALTH.</div>

  <p>The problem of saddles in cycles is really one of the greatest moment,
    and will continue to be, so long as any pain or discomfort is felt upon
    the bicycle sufficient to discriminate against it in contradistinction
    to that of sitting on a buggy-seat and being carried over a comparable
    distance.</p>

  <p>Too little attention has been paid to this subject in the past,
    especially during the “Ordinary” <i lang="fr">régime</i>. The general build
    of the Ordinary is such as to make it quite difficult to attach
    comfortable springs and saddles: many and various have been the
    attempts at improvement, but all have been marked by only a comparative
    degree of success. Were it not, however, for this success, small as it
    may be, in making saddles comfortable, the cycling fraternity would
    have had the entire medical profession down upon them, as some of them
    are anyhow.</p>

  <p>Though a layman himself, the writer met a prominent medical man from
    the West at the International Medical Congress, who stated that unless
    these saddles were improved, he would order off all the young men in
    any way under his charge, as he had already been compelled to do in
    several individual cases. It is needless to dwell upon proofs of these
    evils; they are within the knowledge of every bicyclist of experience.
    Almost every rider knows of some special case of complaint, if not one
    of real injury.</p>

  <p>In an examination on one occasion, made by the writer, of some forty
    or fifty wheels at a club house,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span> fully two out of three were found that
    would have been condemned as unridable by any good physician who had
    given the matter careful attention.</p>

  <p>The famous Kirkpatrick style of suspension saddle is a great advance
    on most of the old short patterns, yet the necessary amount of free
    elasticity is sadly lacking in the early patterns, and to some extent
    the deficiency still exists. It is questionable whether the Kirkpatrick
    is much better than some of the English types which, though shorter,
    have a large amount of vertical play by means of good springs. The old
    Harrington cradle spring was a marked advance on the Ordinary, yet it
    was objected to as having “too much motion.” It is little encouragement
    to inventors, when they have, after considerable labor, improved upon
    an old device, to hear riders, who are more anxious to vent their
    opinions than to give honest experience, make an objection to the very
    point so long striven for and finally attained.</p>

  <p>With the Rover pattern, where the room for springs is much more ample,
    harmful results are rapidly vanishing. It is quite a novelty to watch
    the body of a rider upon a well-sprung rear-driver Safety swinging
    through a vertical distance of several inches, when we have been used
    to riding upon a spring of a half or three-quarters of an inch of
    amplitude.</p>

  <p>The writer has examined machines where the saddle leather was down upon
    the sheet-iron frame, and in which the entire motion of the spring
    would not amount to a half-inch. If such devices do not breed mischief,
    it will be for the reason that the riders are simply and absolutely
    impervious to any attack upon their systems, and are possessed of
    spines in their bodies more invulnerable than those in the machines.</p>

  <p>Injury to the spine and other parts naturally showed itself more among
    American than English riders, for the reason that the general average
    of the road surface is much in favor of the latter, but complaint has
    not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span> been unknown even among our English brethren. It is a satisfaction
    to know that many have awakened to this question, and it is a common
    and gratifying sight to see prospective buyers testing the saddle and
    springs of a new mount, as a matter of preliminary inspection, before
    other points are considered at all. It is to be sadly feared that some
    old Ordinary riders suffered greater injury than is commonly supposed
    to have been incurred, but we hope that, since they have come to ignore
    the supposed danger of being “thrown off” by a too lively spring, there
    will be less trouble in the future.</p>

  <p>The worst feature in the bicycle saddle is that nature did not intend
    man to sit astride of anything, and this strikes me as the greatest
    oversight in the general plan of our physical make up as pertaining to
    cycle riding. Nature only provided three convenient ways of supporting
    the body,—to wit, first, on the feet; second, sitting down, with the
    body bent at the thigh joints; and third, lying down. Yet advancing
    civilization desires something a little different from any of these. In
    riding a cycle we find it best to stand erect upon the feet and yet get
    a partial support for the body at the middle,—a condition nature has
    not exactly provided for.</p>

  <p>I have had prepared a cut of that part of the bony structure of the
    body immediately concerned in this question and sufficient in detail to
    enable us to understand the matter with the help of facts known to all.</p>

  <p>It will be seen that the femurs, <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, would have to
    swing forward to a right angle with the trunk of the body—that is,
    perpendicular to the plane of the paper—before we could sit upon the
    bones nature intended,—to wit, on the tuberosities of the ischia,
    <i>e</i>, <i>e</i>, or promontories of the pelvis. This position
    can be partially obtained in horseback riding by the spread of the
    legs over the saddle. When sitting upon a chair or buggy-seat, our
    weight is entirely upon the right bones in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span> right way, but upon
    the bicycle this posture cannot be attained except, possibly, in the
    act of coasting on the Ordinary with the legs over the handle-bar. It
    must be observed, in working the bicycle, that the legs are nearly
    straight down and the feet almost as close together as when walking;
    hence, unless a man is enormously bow-legged, he cannot obtain a rest
    upon the proper bones, as will be seen from the drawing, which shows
    the position of the body while working the pedals. The coaster on
    the Ordinary can sit back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span> upon the broad part of the saddle, and how
    keenly he appreciates the relief immediately felt when he throws his
    legs over the handles! It will be noticed that in the action of the
    bicycle saddle, shown by the dotted lines <i>b</i>, <i>b</i>, the
    narrow part of the saddle rests in an angle, <i>c</i>, formed by the
    pubic bones, which are joined together at the apex of the angle by a
    tissue the doctors call the pubic symphysis. The saddle forms a wedge
    between these bones and tends to spread them; and though this wedging
    action can be modified to some extent, it is still vicious. The broad
    part of the saddle catches a small proportion of the downward pressure
    upon the tuberosities of the ischia directly, but this is only attained
    by severely distorting the fleshy parts, as shown by the dotted lines
    <i>b</i>, <i>b</i>. The body must evidently be supported by the bones
    somewhere; we cannot hang upon mere flesh; and it is doubtful if ever a
    saddle can be devised that will be entirely natural and hygienic; hence
    it is all-important to rest the weight as much as possible on the only
    other available support, the feet. This can be done by keeping well
    over the work and resting upon the pedals, and, above all by using good
    lively springs in connection with the saddle-support. Here again we
    come upon the question of proper springs, and find it has an element of
    health connected therewith as well as one of momentum, as hereinbefore
    treated of.</p>

  <figure class="figcenter illowp60" id="i_097">
    <img src="images/i_097.jpg" alt="">
    <figcaption>Bicycle saddle and anatomy.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>Objection might be raised that the body is less bent at the thigh when
    over the work than it was when we used to kick out forward in the old
    velocipede, and that for this reason we are retrograding. This view
    will not hold, however, for in any practical machine we have to get so
    nearly straight up anyhow that we had better go a little farther, thus
    taking a perfect position for work, and then attack the difficulty of
    support by means of proper saddle-springs and by resting upon the feet
    as much as possible.</p>

  <p>In horseback riding there is no question of self-propulsion;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span> hence
    we can bend our bodies sufficiently to sit upon a good wide seat;
    therefore the difficulty experienced in bicycle saddles does not apply
    in the equestrian art, as would naturally be supposed.</p>

  <p>Upon inquiry as to just what the deleterious results are of riding
    poorly-sprung machines and improper saddles, and the cause thereof, I
    find that “doctors differ” slightly. Some have expressed their opinion
    that the trouble is in the irritation of the pubic symphysis resulting
    from the wedging action before spoken of; others say it is the bending
    and irritation of the coccyx, <i>d</i>, shown in the cut, owing to the
    pressure sustained by it instead of by the ischia; others assert it is
    the constant concussion upon the spine. I am inclined to think that the
    entire field is pretty well covered by a letter from Dr. Entriken, of
    Ohio, which will be found below.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="noindent smcap">“R. P. Scott:</p>

    <p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,—I do not agree with you in the idea as to the
      cause of the trouble with the bicycle saddle. It is not the strain
      upon the ligaments, muscles, or bones, nor the injury to the pubic
      symphysis or adjacent parts, of which physicians complain. It is
      the bruising and irritation of the urethra where it passes under
      the pubic symphysis, and of the prostate gland, etc.; also the
      necessity of muscular action in the lower limbs while the parts are
      so jostled, bruised, and irritated. This muscular action pumps more
      blood into the parts, increasing congestion and the tendency to
      cause disease of the parts I have mentioned....</p>

    <p class="mb0">“Please note the usual narrow saddle fits close to the parts of
      the pubic bones, and does not run back wide enough to allow the
      weight of the body to fall upon the tuberosities of the ischia, as
      in the Mexican and Spanish saddles, but bears upon the soft parts
      between. You will note also that the ordinarily-shaped bicycle
      saddle turns up so as to allow some weight to fall upon the os
      coccyx, or end of the backbone, which brings in another factor in
      producing what has been not inaptly called the ‘bicycle disease.’
      We have pressure where pressure should never be made, and this
      pressure, aggravated by the jolting motion, causing a series of
      rapid concussions to fall upon the spinal column at the point where
      it is not intended to make resistance,—to wit, the extreme end. If
      a saddle could be constructed that would lift the soft parts of
      the perineum comparatively free and cause the weight to rest on
      the promontories of the ischia, thus protecting the soft<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span> parts and
      communicating a less direct shock to the spine, the trouble would
      be substantially overcome. I know the difficulty of accomplishing
      this when the legs must be down and in motion, but some genius will
      probably solve the problem.</p>

      “<span class="smcap">F. W. Entriken.</span>”</div>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Another opinion on the subject of health is as follows, from <cite>The
    Cyclist</cite>, by Dr. Jennings:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“‘It is perhaps inevitable that persons who have no practical
      experience should accuse the exercise, on theoretical grounds,
      of producing various evils, such as varicose veins, hernia,
      hemorrhoids, urethral stricture, and various forms of cardiac and
      nervous diseases. As to varicose veins, it seems to be clearly
      established that in those cases in which this condition is due
      to chronic local causes, to constipation, and a sedentary life,
      <em>actual benefit</em> is derived from cycling, and that even in
      those cases which are due to organic visceral disease no harm is
      done.... As to cardiac and nervous disease, the case is different.
      Race-meetings and the silly craze to “break the record” have
      much to answer for. It is not difficult to understand how such
      exercises may cause permanent injury to the heart, neurasthenia,
      or even organic nervous disease.’ We presume the writer refers to
      such exertions on the part of wholly or partially trained men, for
      we have Dr. Turner’s word for it, and that is also the word of a
      practical athlete, that to men in condition harm does not result.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The importance of some care and knowledge on any subject connected
    with spirited exercise should always be borne in mind; not only should
    we give attention to the matter of saddles, but also to any other
    point which may seem to be important. I append an article from the
    <cite>Bicycling World</cite>, on another branch of the subject of health in
    cycling, which explains itself.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="center">
      “A SOURCE OF DANGER TO WHEELMEN.</p>

    <p>“I would most earnestly call the attention of all wheelmen to that
      most dangerous custom of wearing belts drawn tightly about the
      waist to support the pants, or even where they are laced tightly or
      where there is any constriction about the waist whatever.</p>

    <p>“Many wheelmen are leading sedentary lives, especially the older
      riders, and are not physically in a proper condition to put<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span> forth
      the very severe muscular exertions which all wheelmen are called
      upon to do, and one of the dangers which I wish to particularly
      call attention to is that of causing hernia or rupture.</p>

    <p>“I know of two cases of hernia caused directly by the severe
      exertions put forth in climbing steep hills. One of them was a
      particularly strong, healthy, and robust young man, and I am quite
      confident that the indirect cause of those herniæ was the wearing
      of tight belts. The young man alluded to above has always been very
      active in out-door sports, very fond of lifting, and made it a
      common custom to put forth his utmost strength whenever opportunity
      offered, and he never had any tendency towards such a result until
      he began bicycling, which brought about an entire change in form of
      dress.</p>

    <p>“When any person puts forth his strength in lifting—‘hill-climbing
      is merely a form of lifting’—the abdominal muscles are called
      strongly into play, and if by belting or other means they are
      prevented from expanding and increasing the circumference of the
      waist, their force is then directed towards forcing the abdominal
      contents downward, and thereby greatly increasing the chances of
      causing hernia.</p>

    <p>“The clothing should always be loose about the waist. As suspenders
      are inconvenient to wear and very uncomfortable in hot weather,
      I would suggest that the simplest, and I think the best, way of
      holding up the trousers is by means of a band sewed around the
      inside of the flannel shirt, with buttons sewed through the shirt
      and band and then the button-holes made on an extra band on the
      inside of band of trousers, the same as little boys’ waists and
      trousers are joined.</p>

    <p class="mb0">“I sincerely trust that no one will misconstrue this article as
      condemning wheeling; no one believes in it more thoroughly than
      your humble servant. I am writing from experience, not hearsay,
      and I would desire all wheelmen to give heed to my warning, and so
      avoid a source of danger.</p>

    <div class="right">“L. A. W., 18,954.”</div>

    <p>[“The above is written by a physician who has made a special study
      of hernia.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>”]</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>There are some strong opinions on the other side of this belt
    question, if the belts are of proper kind and rightly worn. Very few
    agree unconditionally with L. A. W. However, it is hoped that no
    alarm will be taken from the discussion of these subjects. They are
    not so serious as might appear, except in cases of gross negligence.
    But whatever danger there may be, it is best to be fully aware of it,
    and thus be forearmed. As to saddles and springs, let riders show the
    makers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span> that they are alive to all improvements which will in any way
    eliminate causes for anxiety in this as well as in other respects, and
    thereby show that the fact of making a mile in a little shorter space
    of time, or that of getting one inch farther up a stiff hill, is not
    all that the modern cyclist proposes to consider.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="subheadc">HEADERS OR CROPPERS.</div>

  <p>“Taking headers,” or, in the parlance of our brethren of England,
    “coming croppers,” is perhaps a trivial heading for any article outside
    of newspaper or wheel periodical gossip, but it has a popular twang,
    and to the fraternity means a great deal. Every rider of the old
    Ordinary can give us personal experiences on this subject; among them
    will be found mishaps too serious to be chronicled in any jesting mood,
    a few so serious that we would fain forget them were not this forbidden
    by our sympathy and respect for the sufferers as fellows of our craft.
    From this sombre side of our story how joyfully we turn to the many
    humorous anecdotes which have been related in every club-room, in some
    of which “we ourselves were part of what we told!”</p>

  <p>The subject would ere this have been obsolete were it not for a large
    number who still maintain the supremacy of the “Ordinary,” and those
    others who, forming an intermediate class between the old and new, have
    unfurled their banner as doughty champions of the “Rational.”</p>

  <p>A header is the act of “going down on the other side,” spoken of in
    a former chapter, or, more definitely, it is the projection of the
    rider over the handle-bar to the ground in advance of his machine. It
    is a simple process, being a mere application of the physical forces
    of gravity and momentum. A moving body tends to keep moving in a line
    until stopped or deviated by some counteracting force. In riding a
    cycle a certain momentum is acquired and kept up against the resisting
    forces of friction, impact of air, road resistance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span> etc. Headers are
    a result of a counteracting force, generally caused by sudden impact
    against a stationary obstacle on the road, or by the forward wheel
    becoming suddenly locked through a failure in the axle-bearings to
    work, or by some clog in the wheel preventing it from revolving freely
    through the fork in which it is hung. There are modifications of the
    header action even in machines of the same sizes of wheels and same
    rake,—rake being a term recognized to express the angle of the front
    fork from the vertical. This rake has to do with the liability to
    headers only in so far as it regulates the centre of gravity of the
    system, “more rake” generally meaning that the rider is farther behind
    the vertical line through the front wheel axle.</p>

  <p>In order to take a header, a certain centre of gravity must get beyond
    a certain line. This centre of gravity will vary in position in
    different machines, and the modifications spoken of cause the line to
    move in a way which is, I think, sometimes overlooked.</p>

  <p>If we discuss the crank Ordinary, it will be noticed that when the
    front wheel is stopped in its forward progress, the frame of the
    machine together with the rider and all other parts of the system
    revolve about the centre of the wheel and cause an action within the
    system, the same as that of the forward wheel revolving backward
    through the fork. Now, it is just when such backward motion is
    prevented, that the gravity line moves and alters the conditions,
    decreasing the liability to headers. If the forward wheel can revolve
    backward through the fork, then, in taking a header, the system,
    exclusive of the forward wheel, will revolve about a point in the wheel
    centre; but if it cannot so revolve, then the entire system, including
    the forward wheel, must all tend to revolve about the point of contact
    of the wheel with the ground. Now, it will be seen in the latter case,
    or anti-header machine as we shall call it, that as the system tends to
    revolve about the point of contact, such point will constantly change;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
    in other words, the wheel must roll onward, and the point of contact
    will therefore advance.</p>

    <figcaption>Header action, smooth road.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>In <a href="#i_105">Fig. 1</a>, in the annexed diagram, we show the distance forward and
    upward, <i>a</i> to <i>b</i>, the rider must be thrown before he gets
    beyond the gravity line, <i>g</i>, in the Ordinary; <a href="#i_105">Fig. 2</a> shows the
    distance when the wheel will not revolve backward through the fork.
    In either case, the header is supposed to be taken on a smooth road
    and not against an obstruction; this can easily occur in vaulting into
    the saddle or in leaning too far forward. It will be noticed that the
    distance the rider is elevated, or, in other words, the amount of work
    done against gravity, is in both cases the same, but the distance
    forward he must be thrown is considerably greater in <a href="#i_105">Fig. 2</a>. This is
    for the reason that while the point of contact, <i>h</i>, with the
    ground remains the same in <a href="#i_105">Fig. 1</a>, in <a href="#i_105">Fig. 2</a> the point rolls on to
    <i>i</i>. For more accurate illustration of the work to be done against
    gravity, and the distance forward the rider must be thrown, see the
    header curves in Figs. <a href="#i_107a">4</a> and <a href="#i_107b">5</a>, farther on.</p>

  <p>We see, then, that the advantage which the anti-header<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span> (No. 2) has
    over the Ordinary machine (No. 1) is not so very great when in both
    cases a smooth road is considered; when, however, we consider the
    element of an obstacle in the path, the difference is much more in
    favor of No. 2. Let us compare the action of both classes of machines
    against a four-inch obstruction. In all cases the action of No. 1
    machine will be the same,—that is, the wheel will remain in contact at
    <i>h</i>, <a href="#i_105">Fig. 1</a>, and the saddle will go on over, just as it does in
    the case of no obstruction at all. But in No. 2 the very act of taking
    the header must raise the entire weight and roll the system upon the
    obstacle, as shown in <a href="#i_106">Fig. 3</a>.</p>

    <figcaption>Anti-header wheel action on obstruction.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>The point of contact, <i>h</i>, over and beyond which the centre of
    gravity must be thrown, will not only move forward, as shown in Fig.
    2, but will move to the top of the obstacle <i>i</i>, <a href="#i_106">Fig. 3</a>. Or, if
    the question is one of a rut or indentation in the surface of the
    roadway, No. 2 will be caused to roll partially or altogether out of
    the rut. Now, since the rider, by the action of his momentum<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span> and that
    of the machine, is rolled upon the obstacle or out of the rut, it is
    easily seen that if he is attending strictly to his work and is at
    all a skilful rider, he can, by a lively thrust upon the pedal at the
    opportune time, right himself and keep the drive-wheel rolling on, in
    which case the rear part of the machine will, in all ordinary cases,
    drop back upon the ground, from which, of course, it will have raised.</p>

  <p>The feature of a non-backward revolution of the drive-wheel through the
    fork is a natural consequence in some lever and clutch machines. This
    element of anti-header has been the subject of an invention in the way
    of an attachment to the Ordinary, contrived with a view to reaching
    the same result, but it cannot be said to be a successful venture in
    the market, the probable reasons being, first, that it interferes, to
    a slight extent, in managing the dismounted wheel, the operator being
    unable to run it backward, as is sometimes desirable; second, that the
    anti-header element has not been really understood or appreciated among
    the fraternity, as it does not appeal to the judgment of the casual
    observer that any such element results from the fact “that a wheel
    won’t run back.” In the lever and clutch machine a third objection is
    raised,—the rider cannot back-pedal, but must depend entirely on the
    brake in descending hills.</p>

  <p>The Rover type of safety machine is practically free from the
    liability to direct headers, for the reason that the centre of gravity
    of the system has to be raised to such a height that the rider swerves
    around sideways before he can go over; nevertheless, a modified form
    of the same might be possible through some remote concatenation of
    circumstances causing the machine to stop and throw the rider bodily
    over the handle-bar without keeping him company on the trip as usual,
    in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span> which case he, at least, escapes the usual subsequent annoyance of
    being pounded by the rear wheel.</p>

  <p>A header cannot result from stopping the rotation of the rear wheel, as
    generally supposed, because the point of contact of the same being in
    the rear of the rider and centre of gravity, the system cannot revolve
    about the said point in a forward direction, or direction of momentum.
    It will be seen, then, that if from any cause the rear wheel leaves the
    ground, which it can do from a rebound against some obstruction, the
    instant it does so the system will be simply carried forward by the
    rolling of the front wheel.</p>

  <p>Headers have been said to result from the above cause in the ordinary
    bicycle, but the writer after several experiments has been unable to
    attain such a result. Yet it is quite possible that it might occur
    from the rebound of the rear wheel in striking an object with great
    force, though it is altogether improbable if the drive-wheel were kept
    fully in motion. An obstruction so great as to bodily raise the wheel
    sufficiently high to throw the centre of gravity over never gets a
    chance to act, since the forward wheel must surmount it first, and
    this is where the header occurs. It can be easily seen that when the
    rear wheel, from any cause, is raised from the ground, there can be
    no action within the system to make it raise any higher or to prevent
    the forward wheel from rolling onward as usual; hence it is evident
    that as soon as the former leaves the ground it will simply drop back
    and rebound again at will. But in the other case, if the front wheel
    is locked, the rear wheel cannot go on in a straight line and it must
    therefore go on over the top.</p>

  <p>In the writer’s experiments on the rear wheel, he had an attendant
    throw a stick between the spokes while in motion; it was not tried at
    very high speed, however, for the reason, perhaps, that any failure
    in the theory above provided might end rather disastrously to the
    experimenter and thereby cause an act of ingratitude<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span> to be perpetrated
    upon the prospective patron of this book, through an inability to ever
    finish it.</p>

  <p>If some ambitious cyclist will kindly complete these experiments, the
    writer will gladly incorporate an account of them in future editions of
    this work, together with an appropriate obituary notice in large type.</p>

  <div class="subheadc">GEARING UP AND DOWN.</div>

  <p>This familiar phrase means simply that the number of revolutions made
    by the drive-wheel in proportion to the number made by the cranks is
    greater or less. Broadly, it varies the relative amount of motion of
    the pedals, and consequently of the feet of the rider in travelling
    over a given distance. In the simple crank device no change can be
    made in this respect except in the length of the cranks, but in all of
    the sprocket-chain devices it is also possible to change the amount of
    motion in the pedals by altering the size of one or the other of the
    sprocket-wheels. In lever machines and in those which have the sun and
    planet connection, either with an oscillating lever or full revolving
    crank, it is generally possible, by some alteration, to produce the
    same effect as that of changing a sprocket-wheel as mentioned. The
    variation in the length of crank produces an effect comparable to the
    change of gearing in so far as the distance through which the feet
    travel in covering a certain distance is concerned, but the difference
    lies in this, that altering the crank means a given number of
    revolutions in a circle of varying radius, while altering the gearing
    means a variable number of revolutions in a circle of given radius, in
    order to cover a given length of road.</p>

  <p>In popular language, if a rider wishes more power, he must lengthen
    the crank or decrease the size of the sprocket-wheel on the crank-axle;
    <i>vice versa</i>, if he desires greater speed and less power, he must
    shorten the crank or enlarge the sprocket-wheel connected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span> therewith.
    It is needless to say that enlarging the gear-wheel on the crank-axle
    produces the same effect as decreasing the size of that on the
    drive-wheel.</p>

  <p>In a sprocket-crank machine the real question of gearing is whether
    to change the length of crank or proportion of the sizes of the
    gear-wheels; but you can’t by any combination get power and speed both
    with the same amount of work done by the rider.</p>

  <p>Simple as all this matter of gearing is, it is probable that there is
    no feature in cycles so indefinitely understood, or, we might say, so
    persistently distorted. The only trouble is that riders will not stop
    to apply a most fundamental law of nature. If we gain speed, we lose
    power; if we gain power, we must lose speed. To apply this particularly
    to cycles, if you gear up for speed, you must push harder; if we gear
    down, we need not push so hard, but must kick faster or go more slowly,
    provided in each case the length of crank is the same. We cannot go
    fast and push easy unless we increase the strength of the man. To
    go over the same distance of given road, the same amount of work is
    required, no matter how the machine is arranged through which it is
    done.</p>

  <p>This subject was better understood when no element but the length of
    the crank was to be considered; but now, since bicycles have appeared
    that are capable of being changed to a high or low gear, some riders
    persist in treating it as an entirely new problem. It has in one
    respect a new feature in that greater or less speed can be had without
    decreasing or increasing the length of the crank; that is, since the
    comparative speed of the pedal and rim of the wheel in space can be
    varied either by the length of the crank or the number of revolutions
    of the same, we can make one turn of a six-inch crank do the same work
    at the same foot-pressure as two turns of a three-inch crank at the
    same pressure. Now, this is a valuable feature, because it allows us to
    increase the vertical amplitude<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span> through which to transmit power without
    change in the velocity of the pedal through space.</p>

  <p>A convenient standard has been adopted in gearing cycles by comparing
    the speed of the driver to that of a wheel and crank connected and
    revolving together, as in the Ordinary; that is to say, a thirty-inch
    wheel geared to sixty means that one turn of the crank will drive the
    thirty-inch wheel twice around, as it must do in order to cover the
    same distance as one turn of a sixty-inch wheel. To find how high the
    machine is geared, divide the number of teeth in the sprocket-wheel
    on the crank by the number in the sprocket-wheel on the driver, then
    multiply the result by the diameter in inches of the drive-wheel. In
    short, the speed indicated by the size of the drive-wheel of the geared
    machine is to the real speed as the number of teeth in the gear upon
    the wheel is to the number of teeth in the gear on the crank-axle.</p>

  <p>When tricycles first appeared in which the power was transmitted
    through sprocket-wheels and chain, there was quite a cry for
    “high-geared” machines; but the mistake was soon discovered, and buyers
    eventually found that moderate gearing was best, and in fact many
    adopted a level gearing (equal-sized sprocket-wheels) with thirty-six-
    to forty-two-inch drivers. Notwithstanding this experience, when the
    geared bicycles came in there was still a great cry for fancied high
    speed. An English maker in 1885 complained to the writer that it was
    the bane of his existence,—this howl for high gears,—when it was well
    known to him that buyers would eventually be dissatisfied. It was of no
    use to make, said he, what is really needed; customers will not even
    try the machines, so sure are they that by their scheme “they can fly
    through the air with the greatest of ease,” which expression, when used
    by the ordinary man, means something like pulling a ten-horse load with
    one mule.</p>

  <p>In the early days of gearing, few riders could be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span> more easily
    offended than by intimating that they wanted a low-geared machine,
    say fifty to fifty-two; no less than sixty or seventy would satisfy
    their cravings for great speed, and in fact the writer has been asked
    seriously, “Why not gear her up to about a hundred?” But now that the
    idol of so many riders has been shattered, they will too complacently
    accept the word of the maker as to what they need, and hence there is
    a real substantial reason for investigating this matter. The advent
    of the gearing process has developed a new point, as a result of
    conditions spoken of, which is to make the machine suit the rider’s
    strength and physical peculiarities as well as to fit him in the
    length of leg,—a point to which insufficient attention has been paid.
    If one man wants a machine geared to fifty-six or sixty, there is no
    conceivable reason why another who happens to have the same length of
    inseam of his trousers should want the same; nor is it a matter simply
    of strength: if two men can make the same number of miles in a day,
    it is fair to presume that they are of nearly equal riding capacity,
    yet each may accomplish the work most easily on machines geared quite
    differently. An instance of this kind has occurred to the writer,
    in riding day after day on a machine geared to about forty-eight,
    with a man who preferred and could do his best work on a sixty. This
    difference held good on smooth or rough roads, and as a matter of my
    own experience it is a pleasure to ride a low gear, and distressing
    toil to use a higher. There are others whose experience is just the
    reverse, and it is useless to try to guess at what is wanted; it is
    best not to go to either extreme in buying unless you have proved
    the necessity by extended experience on the road. It would be well
    for all riders to avail themselves of any good opportunity to make a
    thorough trial of machines geared differently from each other, for it
    is possible to be unsuited and never know it. Even if you have been
    able to lead the van when you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span> have been out on a run, you do not know
    but that you could have led it much easier on something else than that
    which you rode. The physical system in man may easily become adapted
    to a wheel which at first was not suitable, but there are those to
    whom certain gearing will always be wrong. It is safe to say that the
    prevailing mistake in the past has been the use of too high gears,
    though this has been much improved of late by the use of long cranks.</p>

  <p>There is one subject which should be touched upon with great caution,
    since the prospects of some very worthy inventors might be unjustly
    interfered with; it is that of multiple or two speed-gears. I have
    tried to impress upon the reader the importance of gearing to suit his
    strength, yet when once suited it is extremely doubtful if he should
    ever change it; at least it is doubtful if he should do so on the same
    trip or even during the same season. When a rider transfers his base of
    operations from a level to a hilly country permanently, a change in his
    gear may not be out of the way; but to fix the machine for more or less
    power alternately as hills and levels are met with is, in the light of
    my experience, more tiresome than the necessary variation in the effort
    of the man.</p>

  <div class="subheadc">THE MODERN ROVER, OR REAR-DRIVING SAFETY.</div>

  <p>As machines of this general type bid fair to engage the attention of
    cyclists to a marked degree, it seems in place to give them more than
    a passing notice in the general discussion. It is fair to presume that
    more than one-half of all the machines sold in the immediate future
    will be more or less after this general pattern.</p>

  <p>The introduction of the Rover has afforded us one of the most amusing
    incidents in cycling history. The writer of these pages happened to
    be in Coventry during the summer of ’85, and he had a fortuitous
    opportunity, fondly accepted, of inventing fun at the expense of the
    “Crocodile” and of joining in the general laugh at the (alleged)
    ridiculous attempt of a Coventry firm to “foist” (<i>sic</i>) this most
    extraordinary freak of cycling inventive genius, under a new name, upon
    the market.</p>

  <p>In the fall of the same year a notable Washington agent, allured by the
    attractive notices of a great prize for a hundred-mile race, imported
    one of these self-same incongruous specimens into this country.
    After a few weeks of hilarious humor, followed by a sullen contempt
    for the thing, this Washingtonian shipped it to a great American
    manufacturer, who made sport over it for a year or two before we all
    began to scramble around and make ready to prove that each one of us
    individually “saw it all the time.” It has been a hard pull, however,
    and it is still uncertain on whom it did first begin to dawn that
    somebody had been guilty of colossal stupidity.</p>

  <p>One thing the Rover accomplishes, previously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span> touched upon, is the
    location of the rider as nearly over the work as he chooses to be;
    which has been the end and aim of all our efforts in that direction.
    Had this machine been offered to the public, in good shape, at the
    end of the old bone-shaker <i lang="fr">régime</i>, it is questionable if the
    Ordinary would ever have acquired the prominence it did. In early
    times, when learning to ride a tall machine was considered quite a feat
    of gymnastic exercise, such as only the young and sprightly could ever
    perform, many, who afterwards by force of circumstances did accomplish
    the feat, would never have tried it if there had been anything else,
    such as the present Safety, to learn upon. Every accident on the
    Ordinary would have told heavily against it in the market, and every
    severe casualty would have made a new Safety rider; as it was, however,
    there was only one of three things to do,—take to a three-track
    machine, stop riding, or try the old mount again. It is needless to say
    that, almost to a man, the last condition was accepted, and the result
    is that now we have a class of men who can handle an Ordinary with such
    dexterity that many of them conscientiously aver that there can be
    nothing safer. However, among those most devoted to it at the present
    time there are few, if any, of the close observers who would have
    stood sponsor for their favorite machine had the rear-driver made its
    appearance in its present form prior to the advent of the Ordinary. To
    say that the latter would ever have obtained a footing above the level
    of a fad or a curiosity, would be equal to denying that the Safety will
    now ever hold an enviable place among us.</p>

  <p>In the minds of many the sprocket-wheels and chain stood much against
    the introduction of the rear-driver; true, many good tricycles were
    implanted firmly on the market with such devices for conveying power
    to its necessary locality, but there was always such a vast chasm
    lying between the single- and double-track machines that riders did
    not care to get down to minute<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span> details of differences. To an Ordinary
    rider the idea of sprocket-wheels was, and is yet, for that matter,
    an abomination, only second to that of being dropped down from his
    elevated position to the humble plane in which his fellow on the Safety
    is wont to revel; but nothing in the way of change in the cycle art is
    unbearable after we become accustomed to it.</p>

  <p>No doubt the old Kangaroo, as bad a failure as it was, led us up
    to endure more complacently the rear-driver in respect to the
    sprocket-chain; yet in no type of machine could the subject have been
    brought to our notice in a worse form. The tricycles using a single
    chain did away with one of the great evils which appertain to this
    system as found in the Kangaroo, in which we have two chains working
    entirely independently. The evil of such an arrangement is easily seen:
    no old Kangaroo rider, or rider of any other double-chain device, is
    ignorant of the annoyance caused by reversing the slack in each at
    every half-revolution of the pedal. Keep the chains ever so tight, this
    slack will be felt as the pedal crosses the dead-centre line at the top
    and the bottom. In spite of all this, some reputable makers persist in
    constructing rear-drivers having the double chain,
    and as a matter of course justly fail to meet with much approval from
    the riders thereof.</p>

  <p>A word in regard to the nature of sprocket-wheels and chain. It is
    perhaps not generally understood how important it is that they should
    be well made, with especial view to resist stretching and alteration
    of pitch, any tightening device, no matter how deftly made, being
    an inconsistency in mechanics. To be sure, the spreading of the
    wheel-centres cannot do much harm, and it saves some annoyance, but it
    does not cure the real evil, nor is it any better to take a link out;
    it is the length of each and every link that is wrong, and it can only
    be cured by either changing each link or by altering the sizes of the
    sprocket wheels.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span></p>

  <p>Two gear-wheels cannot run properly together unless they are
    proportional in size to the number of teeth. Now, the stretching of
    a sprocket-chain alters the pitch in a manner similar to that of
    retaining the same number of teeth in each of two intermeshing wheels,
    and then altering the size of one. A sprocket-chain acts substantially
    as an idle wheel; when it stretches we have, as it were, this idle
    wheel made larger while the size of the others and the number of teeth
    in each remain the same. Increasing the distance between the centres
    does not affect the size of the wheels, and when a sprocket-chain
    stretches or becomes longer by wear the wheels should either be larger
    or else the number of teeth diminished. It is a general idea among
    mechanics that chain gearing is about the most undesirable of all means
    of transmitting power we have. This is perhaps an exaggeration, and
    I think the cycle art has proved it to be so; but the idea no doubt
    is fostered by this constant tendency of the chain to stretch, and
    when this stretch takes place a very considerable amount of friction
    must result. There is another annoyance felt by patrons of the small
    wheel: the chains being low down and well oiled, as they should be,
    especially if once they become stretched, have a superlative capacity
    for accumulating and holding dirt, causing a grinding second only to
    that of a finely-set quartz-crusher. This feature is not so much to be
    deplored if the dirt can be kept out of the chain-link bearings, since
    it is not the wear of the link against the tooth of the wheel, but that
    within the link, which makes it longer, alters the pitch, and causes
    great friction.</p>

  <p>We shall, however, have to accept this chain arrangement for the
    present in Safeties, as it cannot be helped. Some ingenious inventor
    will no doubt ere long come to our assistance; but until then we can
    tolerate it with a good grace, since it is a necessary concomitant of
    so valuable an acquisition to our assortment of mounts.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span></p>

  <p>There is apparently little difference in the construction of the crank
    Rover Safeties, yet there is more than a cursory glance would lead us
    to suspect. To begin with, there is quite a variation in the slant of
    the neck or front fork, many makers giving a considerable curve to
    the fork, thus throwing the neck much straighter up. Then we have the
    telescope head, where the front fork revolves inside the tubular front
    extension of the main frame; and lastly, the swing-joint or Stanley
    head.</p>

  <p>No very startling difference in the durability of these two heads has
    as yet developed itself. The telescope is often hung in balls, which
    makes it work as freely as the Stanley, if not more so; it has also a
    little advantage in appearance; still, a large majority of the makers
    have adopted the Stanley, probably because it is a little cheaper and
    quite as efficient. There seems to be less disadvantage in the slant
    of the front fork than might have been expected. According to an old
    theory in the Ordinary, the more nearly vertical the head, the less
    “sensitive” the steering; but experience demonstrates that by practice
    all machines are so easily steered that the point is really not so
    vital.</p>

  <p>The original Rover machine as put upon the market has everything
    combined to give it a full slant in the neck; that is to say, it has a
    large thirty-six-inch front wheel and no curve to the fork, while in
    other machines of the same general pattern a thirty-inch front wheel
    is used with considerable curve to the fork, which taken together make
    the neck almost vertical; riders, however, are equally satisfied with
    either style.</p>

  <p>It will be well to notice here that though I speak of the curve of the
    fork in relation to steering, it really has necessarily nothing to do
    with it, since a perfectly straight fork could have a more vertical
    head bearing than one much curved.</p>

  <p>The slant of the pivotal line is the important feature,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span> and this may
    be varied in either by bending the fork or, in the Stanley, by setting
    back the lower bearing.</p>

  <p>The four drawings below show necks of equal slant and considerable
    variation in the curve or shape of the forks.</p>

    <img src="images/i_122.jpg" alt="">
    <figcaption>Rear-driver front forks.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>Any of the four patterns above work exactly the same in the hands of
    the rider.</p>

  <p>So much for the manner of obtaining slant of the head or pivotal
    connection, as we shall call it; but as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span> to the amount of this slant it
    is desirable to obtain much more can be said.</p>

  <p>The great system of castering, so knowingly discussed by some
    expounders of cycling faith, has in it really something of substantial
    importance. It is asserted that if the machine is so constructed that
    the line of pivotal connection strikes the ground in front of the point
    of contact of the wheel (see <a href="#i_123">Fig. 1</a>), a castering element comes into
    play which will cause the machine to retain its forward course, and
    enables the rider to go “hands off.” Note that the line <i>a b</i>
    strikes at <i>c</i> in front of <i>d</i>.</p>

  <figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_123">
    <img src="images/i_123.jpg" alt="">
    <figcaption>Supposed caster.    Real caster.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>I have observed many rear-drivers, and cannot see that this makes much
    difference; the various kinds seem to be equally well ridden, with
    respect to easy steering, if only the riders happen to be thorough
    experts; of course all sorts of theories in regard to the action of the
    steering have been advanced.</p>

  <p>I take it that there is only one truly tenable theory of castering;
    this when applied will obviate “sensitiveness” completely and under
    all circumstances; it is as follows: The pivotal connection must be
    such that the line <i>a b</i> strikes in front of the point of support,
    as before spoken of, and it must also be so constructed and placed in
    such a position that no motion of the handle-bar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span> will cause the machine
    to lower its centre of gravity. If by turning the handles any weight
    is lowered, you can depend upon it that the force of gravity, always
    tending to lower this weight, will inversely cause the handle-bar to
    turn. It will be noticed that when the machine stands upright the
    steering apparatus is not in a state of stable equilibrium; that is to
    say, the weight of the machine tends to shift the wheel, and it can
    hardly keep straight by means of such castering element as results
    simply from the line of the pivotal connection striking in front of the
    point of contact.</p>

  <p>The necessary conditions are as follows (see <a href="#i_123">Fig. 2</a>): The pivotal line
    <i>a b</i> must strike at <i>c</i> in front of <i>d</i>, and the line
    <i>a b c</i> must be vertical in order that no motion on its axis can
    lower any weight when the machine stands upright. Now, it follows
    from these conditions that the head must be vertical and no part of
    the pivotal line in the rear of a vertical through the centre of the
    wheel.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

  <p>The automatic steering devices do not work as successfully on a
    bicycle as on the leading wheel of a tricycle. There are two principal
    plans which have been in use; in one of which a spring forces the
    steering-bar into a position for running straight ahead; the other
    plan for the same purpose consists in a V slot and pin. In the latter
    the weight of the rider keeps the wheel straight by forcing the pin
    into the bottom of the V slot, and it will rest there until forced
    out by the action of the handle-bar. Either of the above devices
    is objectionable in a bicycle, because the constant working of the
    steering-bar for the purpose of balancing is so continuous, as compared
    with that of steering pure and simple, that any force tending to hold
    it in any one position will soon tire the arms and make riding more
    laborious.</p>

  <p>A new form of the rear-driving Safety was shown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span> in the season of 1887,
    invented by a German. I give herewith a cut of the same, citing what he
    claims.</p>

  <figure class="figcenter illowp68" id="i_125">
    <img src="images/i_125.jpg" alt="">
    <figcaption>The “Rothigiesser” principle.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“Can be ridden any distance and on any road without using the
      handle-bar. The new principle—pedals on the rear wheel and saddle
      on the front wheel—is just the reverse of the construction of the
      ordinary bicycle, and is the only true principle for a Safety; the
      fault of the common rear-driving Safeties being that both saddle
      and pedals are fixed on the rear wheel, so that the front wheel
      must be controlled by the arms of the rider.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>I have tried the principle, but could not get much out of it. If there
    is anything in it at all it would be quite valuable; but I am inclined
    to the opinion that the inventor relied rather too much on his theory
    and not enough on actual practice. Notice that the handle-bar, trunk of
    the body, arms, and saddle are all within one system, there being no
    power to steer except in the action between the trunk and feet, instead
    of between the arms and trunk, as in other machines.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span></p>

  <p>A new machine has been favorably noticed of late which strikes me as a
    modification of the German’s principle, or rather as a combination of
    that with the old plan of steering. In this device there is some motion
    between the saddle and the handles, as of old, and in addition thereto
    we find a motion between the saddle and the pedals, which is intended
    possibly to combine all of the good elements. The cut explains itself.</p>

  <p>But to return to our mutton. The important features which
    have compelled us to recognize with favor this most homely and
    awkward-looking machine—the modern rear-driving Safety—are, first, the
    safety element, and, secondly, the advantage of being more nearly over
    the work, these two features including many minor characteristics. Then
    there are a number of independent peculiarities which can hardly be
    said to necessarily belong to this type of machine, but which are still
    adopted in it, such, for instance, as gearing up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span> and down, foot-rests
    for coasting, etc. Until recently there did not seem to be any great
    fault in the machine except its looks, but a controversy has arisen
    which is not only extremely important but is so far unsettled; I refer
    to the discussion of the <em>side-slip</em>, which, in showing the number
    of explanations that different observers will give for the same set of
    facts, has been not unmixed with an element of the humorous.</p>

  <div class="subheadc">THE SIDE-SLIP OF THE SAFETY.</div>

  <p>The question of side-slip is not entirely new; it was first mooted in
    connection with the Safety of the Kangaroo type, which had a driver of
    from thirty-six to forty inches in front of a rear wheel of eighteen
    or twenty inches, as will be noticed in the cut of this machine
    given hereinafter. Now, to come to the specific features supposed to
    account for the side-slip, note that, in order to make room for the
    sprocket-wheels, the cranks had to be unusually wide apart and, by the
    necessary construction of the machine, also very low down; in other
    words, the machine had a very wide tread, swinging very close to the
    ground. The slip of this wheel was something fearful to behold, and
    its cause was supposed to be fully explained by the peculiarities of
    construction just noted, in accordance with a theory which, though
    religiously believed in at the time, has of late been somewhat shaken,
    and which we now proceed to develop.</p>

  <p>In order to compare the different machines in respect to this theory,
    suppose we take, first, the Ordinary with a fifty-inch wheel and
    cranks, say, eight inches apart, or four inches from the centre of the
    wheel to either crank. Now, if the pedal <i>b</i> (<a href="#i_129">Fig. 1</a>) is four
    inches long, the distance from the centre of the pedal to the centre
    of the axle of the drive-wheel is six inches, and the diameter of the
    wheel fifty inches; then, when the crank is extended horizontally out
    in front, this being the position when it is supposed to be subjected
    to the greatest strain, we have the following conditions (see <a href="#i_129b">Fig. 2</a>):</p>

  <div class="col50">

    </figure>
  </div>

  <div class="center bold mt0">Side-slip diagrams.</div>

  <p>Let <i>a b</i> represent the distance of the centre of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span> wheel from
    the centre of the pedal, <i>a c</i> the vertical height of the pedal
    from the ground, and <i>W</i> the weight of the man. Then <i>W</i>
    applied vertically downward at <i>b</i> will create a horizontal
    side-slip pressure, <i>R</i> at <i>c</i>, in the direction of the
    arrow, such that <i>R</i> = <i>W</i> <span class="frac"><sup><i>ab</i></sup><sub><i>ac</i></sub></span>. If, then,
    <i>W</i> = 150 pounds and <i>a b</i> and <i>a c</i> = 6 and 25 inches
    respectively, we have <i>R</i> = 150 × <span class="frac"><sup>6</sup><sub>25</sub></span> = 36 pounds. Supposing the
    theory to be correct, the above may be said to represent the side-slip
    resultant in the fifty-inch Ordinary. In the Kangaroo the cranks,
    being below<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span> the centre of the wheel, average about twelve inches from
    the ground when power is applied. The pedals are about a foot apart,
    so that <i>ab</i> = 8, <i>ac</i> = 12, and <i>W</i> = 150, whence
    <i>R</i> by the same formula equals one hundred pounds. The above,
    though perhaps slightly exaggerated in its application to some of the
    Kangaroo patterns, is substantially correct, showing the difference to
    be sixty pounds against it. According to this theory, then, the greater
    the tread and the less the distance of the pedals from the ground, the
    greater should be the side-slip.</p>

  <p>Appertaining to this matter, I have used a machine with the same
    sizes of wheels as those found in the Kangaroo, but in which the power
    devices were very close together, and I have found it comparatively
    free from slip; and I am also informed by riders of the machine called
    the Facile, in which the pedals are closer together, that it is
    remarkably free from the same difficulty. But these facts cannot be
    taken as a proof of the theory under consideration, for the reason that
    the application of the formula <i>R</i> = <i>W</i> <span class="frac"><sup><i>ab</i></sup><sub><i>ac</i></sub></span>
    to the two machines just spoken of, at best, still gives, as a result,
    a large amount of side pressure, which in actual practice does not
    exist. What difference it may make in the Facile or other treadle
    machines that the point of application of power is in the rear of
    the driving axle, I cannot say, or what difference a lever motion
    would show as compared with the simple crank is also not apparent;
    in fact, there is very little of established data from which to draw
    a conclusion, and a good reason which would now deter any cautious
    man from offering much experience or any theory in the matter will
    be readily surmised after reading the following extracts from the
    <cite>Cyclist</cite> on the subject.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="center">“SIDE-SLIPPING ON SAFETIES.</p>

    <p>“One of the principal causes of the falling out of favor of the
      ‘Kangaroo’ type of Safety was the great proneness it had to
      side-slipping upon greasy roads, and it was confidently and freely
      asserted when the rear-driver was introduced that this defect was,
      in its construction, overcome. That this is not the case every one
      who has had any extensive experience with this class of machine
      will admit; indeed, the side-slipping of the Safety is its one
      great fault. As our readers know, the forks of a Safety of this
      type are considerably sloped,—some more so than others. It matters
      not whether the forks are straight or curved, so far as the point
      we are dealing with now is concerned. The sloping of the fork
      places the wheel, unless travelling in an absolutely straight line,
      more or less on its side. The result is manifest. There is a strong
      force behind pushing it forward. So long as the ground gives enough
      frictional resistance to the wheel, well and good; but so soon as
      the surface is lubricated, as it is, by the slippery mud, then the
      tendency is at once to push the machine over. This tendency is
      increased, as with the side-slipping upon other forms of machines,
      by a sloping road surface, the side of a rut, or the cant of the
      machine in turning a corner; and, moreover, the harder the rider
      pushes the more chance there is of the machine slipping. Having,
      then, pointed out the cause of side-slipping, it remains for those
      who devote their time and talents to invention to overcome it. So
      far as we can see, a vertical steering-fork should do that which is
      needed.”<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

    <p class="p2">“[1113].—Your leader in last week’s issue <i>re</i> the
      side-slipping of rear-driving Safety bicycles is, in my opinion,
      somewhat calculated to mislead. I cannot for one moment think you
      are right in stating that the cause of side-slipping in this class
      of machine is the sloping fork of the steering-wheel. You conclude
      with the following remark: ‘So far as we can see, a vertical
      steering-fork should do that which is needed.’ Here again I must
      say I emphatically disagree with you. <em>Had you tried one of the
      old ‘B.S.A.’</em> Safeties, you would not say this. These
      machines were far worse than any sloping-forked machine. <em>I gave
      one an extensive trial</em>, and found that the side-slipping was
      one of its worst features. Further, you have only to take one of
      the old ‘Humber’ Safeties, for example, with the perpendicular
      fork. Was side-slipping impossible on these?</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span></p>

    <p>“In my humble opinion, sir, you have entirely overlooked the real
      cause of side-slipping on rear-driving Safeties, which is <em>the
      absence of sufficient weight on the driving-wheel</em>. My argument
      is still further proved by the fact that the ‘Scout’ Safety
      (two-chain rear-driver), on which machine the weight of the rider
      is thrown as near as possible over the centre of the axle, will not
      slip sideways on the most greasy surface; and again, the American
      ‘Star,’ I am told by experienced riders of this machine, possesses
      a like good quality. Here, again, the weight is almost entirely on
      the driver.</p>

    <p class="mb0">“The subject of side-slipping on the most popular machine of the
      day—viz., the rear-driving Safety—is so serious a one that I am
      sure you will see your way to open your columns to a discussion on
      the same.</p>

    <div class="right smcap">Sydney Lee.”</div>

    <p class="p2">[“The position of the weight doubtless forms an important factor in
      the question of side-slipping, and the thanks of the community are
      due to Mr. Lee for his experiments in that direction. We are bound
      to say, however, that our experience, so far as the question as to
      which wheel slips first, and also as to the stability of the tandem
      Safety on greasy roads, and on the point of safety at high speed,
      is exactly the reverse of that found by Mr. Lee.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>”]</p>

      very much inclined to your opinion as to the cause,—viz., the
      canting over of the steering-wheel in turning,—which can only be
      obviated, as you suggest, by having a vertical steering-post.</p>

  <p>The above quotations explain themselves, and many other such, “from
    experience” (<i>sic</i>), might be given. The <cite>Cyclist</cite> editor
    and Mr. Lee are justly considered to be authorities in such matters.
    It is beyond all question that all of these writers are strictly
    honest and speak the truth so far as they know it, but we may well
    ask, under these circumstances, what is any individual experience
    worth? Certainly nothing, until it becomes verified and definitely
    settled by the general<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span> verdict of all sides. For such reasons the
    writer is loath to offer his own observations on this subject as of
    much value. It is a peculiar fact, and one worthy of notice by all who
    desire to form an accurate opinion in the matter of cycling or of any
    other art, that the experience of an interested party is generally as
    one-sided as his desires. A machine will do an enormous amount in the
    mind of the user, if he wants it to; and this is not said in a spirit
    of criticism or deprecation, for the writer has found himself just
    as liable to the same error as others. In being interested, I do not
    mean that it is necessary to be financially interested; all a man has
    to do is to <em>take a side</em>, and he is deeply enough interested
    for all practical purposes: let him set up an opinion and ten to
    one his experience will bear him out, not in the way of villanous,
    premeditated misrepresentation, but results will honestly appear to
    justify him. It does not appear that we must contend with this vicious
    tendency to any greater extent in connection with the cycle than in any
    other art. Almost every rider is prone to consider himself an expert
    in our pet subject, and it very often happens that he is; yet he may
    not be an observer capable of defending himself against himself in the
    delusions of experience.</p>

  <p>Having probably confused the reader’s mind sufficiently by this
    time to go on with the subject, I may say that another fact why the
    reasoning and formula in regard to the side-slip are not correct is
    that the same rule applied to the Rover does not in any way justify
    the results we find by experience. The slipping of the Rover is much
    more than it should be, in the light of any conclusion based on our
    formula; in fact, I believe the entire theory is, and always has been,
    an unmitigated blunder. A well-known correspondent, Mr. Gerald Stoney,
    has thrown a little light on the subject by an article in the <cite>Irish
    Cyclist</cite>, which, though death to one theory, sets up another still
    of dubious tenability.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span></p>

  <blockquote>
  <p class="center">“SIDE-SLIPPING OF BICYCLES.</p>

    <p>“Mr. Gerald Stoney, in last week’s <cite>Irish Cyclist</cite>, adds the
      following to this interesting and important discussion. It will
      be noticed his deductions differ both from those of Mr. Lee and
      ourselves.</p>

    <p>“In a leader in <cite>The Cyclist</cite> of November 28, the reason that
      low machines of the Kangaroo type slip more than the high Ordinary
      is referred to the pressure of the foot being low down, pushing
      the bottom of the wheel to one side more than in a high machine
      when it is high up. We should wish to point out that no such effect
      can take place so long as the pressure of the foot does not cause
      the machine to wabble; since, so long as there is no change in
      the velocity or direction of motion of the machine, the position,
      direction, or amount of internal forces, such as the pressure of
      the foot, do not affect the position, direction, or amount of
      external forces, such as the pressure of the wheel on the ground.
      This is one of the first great elementary principles of mechanics.
      The reason why a small bicycle has, in general, more tendency to
      slip sideways than one in which the rider is seated high up is,
      that if the wheel slips off a stone or down the side of a rut, the
      distance sideways to which the wheel will slip is independent of
      the size of the wheel, and depends on the size of the stone or rut,
      the state of the road, the speed the machine is going at, etc. But
      the amount by which the machine is inclined to the vertical from a
      given side-slip will depend on how high the centre of gravity is,
      and, therefore, on how high the rider is seated, and accordingly
      it will be less the higher the saddle is. Now, it is a theorem
      in mechanics, which we will ask the reader to assume, that the
      greater this inclination the greater the tendency of the wheel to
      go on slipping, when it has hopped off the rut, stone, etc., and,
      therefore, the higher the saddle the less side-slipping there will
      be in <em>similar machines</em>.’”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>I think the above sufficiently exposes the sophistry of the wide-tread
    theory, but lest some of the old adherents to the idea should not be
    willing to accept Mr. Stoney’s mechanical reasoning, I have had made a
    device to test the matter in this way (see <a href="#i_135">Fig. 3</a>).</p>

    <figcaption>Roller experiment.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span></p>

  <p>We have an upright frame provided with two cross pieces, <i>b c</i>
    and <i>e f</i>, a saddle at <i>a</i>, rests for the feet at <i>b</i>
    and <i>c</i>, and a roller, <i>d</i>, placed under <i>e f</i>. Sitting
    upon the saddle <i>a</i>, I was totally unable to move the roller
    <i>d</i> by any pressure upon either pedal <i>b</i> or <i>c</i>. The
    above I consider conclusive proof and the result unbiased by prejudice
    in trying the experiment, because I tested the matter before looking
    carefully into Mr. Stoney’s article and becoming convinced that in this
    he is right. The laws applying to internal forces or forces within
    a system are very often disregarded, and especially are internal
    confounded with external forces, as in this case. In any machine
    where the rider throws his weight on and vertically over the pedal,
    the formula given for the side-slip does represent a force acting to
    swing the machine out of perpendicular and to cause it to “wabble,”
    as Mr. Stoney calls it, but not to slip it on the surface of the
    roadway, as many would suppose. The rider rarely, however, throws his
    weight directly over the pedal sideways, as he does in raising upon
    it in a forward direction in order to get over the work. The lateral
    or wabbling strain in a cycle of the foot-pressure in one direction
    is balanced by the pull on the handle-bars and pressure of the leg
    against the saddle. The only feasible connection the formula theory
    can possibly have in this matter is that the thrust on the pedal is so
    sharp and violent that the inertia of the man and other heavy parts of
    the system are not perceptibly affected sideways; hence we might get
    an action against the slight weight in the lower part of the wheel. I
    cannot, however, detect any slipping action of this or any other kind
    in the roller experiment.</p>

  <p>The futility of an effort to slip the machine sideways by a force upon
    the crank might be illustrated in this manner: Suppose the drive-wheel
    of an Ordinary is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span> made rigidly fast to the front fork. Now, it would be
    impossible for the rider to slip the tire on the road-bed by pressure
    on the crank, as he can when the wheel is free to revolve in its
    bearings, no matter how long the crank may be; if the rider leans out
    over it, the machine could be rolled forward, but not slipped on the
    surface. Loosen the wheel so that it can revolve as usual, then it
    can be slipped, as every good rider well knows. Suppose now that the
    drive-wheel is rigidly fixed in the frame of the bicycle so far as any
    lateral motion is concerned, and the wheel cannot revolve within the
    system about any horizontal line at right angles to the axle of the
    wheel, as it would have to do in order to make it slip in the manner
    it would in the other case, then it is easy to see that the machine
    and rider might be rolled over sideways by throwing the weight on one
    crank; but it cannot be slipped: the only slipping that can occur is
    when the machine is allowed to get out of perpendicular, but the angle
    at which it would begin to slip would be the same regardless of width
    of tread. If the wide tread does affect the slipping, it is the result
    of other forces than those generally supposed.</p>

  <p>I do not believe that the extra weight on the drive-wheel will relieve
    the trouble. I have a Rover pattern machine in which the weight is
    almost entirely in the rear, and I can conscientiously aver that it is
    the worst slipper I was ever on. Now, this is in spite of the fact that
    there was every reason to believe, and to desire, that it should not
    slip at all.</p>

  <p>One of the <cite>Cyclist</cite> correspondents mentions the American Star,
    and justly says that it does not slip; yet that fact could be explained
    by our formula, since it is a tall machine with narrow tread. I cannot
    see, after all, that any theory of wide or narrow tread could be
    applied to the Rover type, even if it were found to be valid in other
    cases, because there seems to be complaint, and I have found it so in
    practice, that the machine will slip more than the old Ordinary, even
    when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span> not pushing on the cranks at all. It seems to slip worse than any
    other in making a curve or in descending hills and upon cobble-stones,
    whether there is any pressure on the crank or not. This will apply
    against the <cite>Cyclist</cite> idea that the slanting fork breeds the
    mischief, since, if it slips in running a straight line, the slant of
    the fork could not possibly have anything to do with it.</p>

  <p>In answer to the idea advanced that the fault is due to the mere size
    of the wheel,—that a large one has more surface exposed to contact,
    etc., and will hold better,—the writer has noticed very little
    difference in his thirty-eight-inch narrow-tread front-driving pattern
    as compared with a fifty-two-inch Ordinary; if there is any difference
    caused by the size of the wheel, this fourteen inches ought to have
    shown itself more than it did.</p>

  <p>If the small wheel in a bicycle is a cause for slipping, we could
    naturally ask why it does not show itself more in the rear wheel of the
    Ordinary. It may be said, in answer to this, that there is but little
    weight on it, and that, not being a driver, whatever capers it might
    choose to cut are ignored by its regal, imperturbable leader; hence, if
    the rear wheel slips, it is immediately drawn up in line again. Another
    plea is that the lack of weight on the front wheel of the Safety makes
    it slip, and then it carries the rear wheel with it. To the last I can
    simply reply, as I would to the <cite>Cyclist’s</cite> notion of the slanting
    fork, that it is the rear wheel which slips first, last, and all the
    time, or else a large majority of riders are very much misled, and
    really can’t tell what is going on under them. Certainly we must say
    that if appearances and sensations of the riders are worth anything,
    the doctrine of the front wheel slipping first must go to the wall
    and carry several ingenious solutions with it. Still another bright
    speculation is, that the unusual bumping of the front wheel holds it
    back, and the rear pushing on, for the nonce, cannot go forward, hence
    it must go sideways.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span></p>

  <p>If we admit that the American Star does not slip, then the theories of
    small weight on the front wheel, the slanting fork, and front bumper
    must all go for naught. There are some other qualifications, however,
    which would modify or exclude the Star as a reference. The fork is
    slanting to a greater extent than in any other machine, but the small
    front steerer is swung from a point directly above the centre, which,
    it is said, gives the wheel a better chance to caster. To our ingenious
    front-bumper friend, I would also suggest the trial of a first-class
    anti-vibrator to the fork, which will let it spring back a good way.</p>

  <p>And again, it has been stated, in regard to the Rover slip, that the
    large rear wheel swings from side to side, or wabbles, humorously
    likened by some to the wagging of a duck’s tail. This feeling of
    disturbance in the rear part of the machine is felt in the Ordinary
    when supplied with the large rear wheel advocated by some, and it may
    have something to do with the slip, though it is hardly possible that
    it would in the well-built, steady machines of the present time.</p>

  <p>As to the high-up saddle or centre of gravity, true, an inch side-slip
    at the ground, of a machine with a low-down centre of gravity, will
    cause it to assume a greater slant or angle from the vertical than a
    higher; hence our friend could well say that when the Safety starts to
    slip it will be more certain to go on down. It is to be noted, however,
    as against this idea, that other machines with low-down saddles do not
    slip.</p>

  <p>Taking all the theories and experiences, <em>pro</em> and <em>con</em>,
    into consideration, I am inclined to believe that no one cause can
    account for the entire difficulty; it is probably a combination of
    smaller elements partly belonging to several of the theories advanced.
    The elements which have been most strongly urged are, first, the driver
    being small; second, the driver being in the rear; third, the weight
    being in the rear; fourth, the work being done between the wheels. All
    these seem to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span> work to the same end. Again, any drive-wheel will slip
    worse than a non-driver, since a sliding force in any direction will
    tend to loosen the hold of the rubber tire from the surface of the
    road more than any rolling action. A short slide from a stone is felt
    more when the weight is upon the wheel, and the drop in rolling off so
    distinctly felt in connection with the small wheel is much sharper than
    a similar action of a large one. A rider can certainly manage himself
    better and more surely when he drives, steers, and leads with the same
    wheel and has his weight upon it. This is what he <em>does</em> on the
    Ordinary and just what he <em>does not</em> do on the rear-driver.</p>

  <p>The deepest and most profound explanation of all side-slip was recently
    proposed to the writer by a mathematician of great ability; but it is
    so complex that he has not worked it out himself yet, though expecting
    daily to hand in the solution. He says it is all from the relation of
    the points, first, of the centre of gravity, second, of the centre of
    oscillation, and third, of the transmission of power, to each other.
    Just where and how they ought to be is, as yet, not fully determined.</p>

  <p>To remedy the evil of the side-slip in the most obvious ways would be
    to make the rear-driving Safety no longer the same machine; it would
    ruin, to a great extent, the very qualities for which it is prized,
    and therefore, if any such theories as before enumerated should prove
    tenable, the only clear way out of the difficulty would be in the use
    of non-slipping tires, if such can be produced.</p>

  <p>In regard to the angle at which any machine will slip in rounding
    a corner, some, who have advanced the idea that the Safety slipped
    because it had to lean more, do not appear to be aware of, or take
    into account, the fact that the angle at which the cycle, or any other
    machine, must lean under such circumstances is entirely independent of
    the height of the centre of gravity. The angle is a function of the
    speed and radius of curvature only.</p>

  <div class="subheadc">THE LADIES’ BICYCLE.</div>

  <p>Probably the most daring innovation the ladies have made in the domain
    of sports and pastime within the past decade consists in their riding
    the bicycle. There is no earthly reason why they should not ride a
    bicycle if they wish to; that is to say, those bicycles of the modern
    type especially made for them. At least no objection can be urged that
    would not equally apply to tandem and single tricycles.</p>

  <p>Notwithstanding the above fact, there is and has been a reluctance
    on the part of the ladies to take up the two-wheeler, and probably a
    greater reluctance on the part of the community at large to countenance
    the step. It is needless to discuss the propriety of ladies riding
    tricycles; the question has been settled by themselves by simply
    riding; and there is the end of it,—they came, saw, rode, and conquered.</p>

  <p>Granted that a woman may ride a tricycle with propriety, it would seem
    a shame to deny her the right to the less cumbersome and much neater
    mount. The ladies’ bicycle certainly is the more modest appearing, if
    we were used to both, and it takes much less work to run it; if it does
    not thrive, it will mean simply that the entire system of ladies’ cycle
    riding must go. Common prejudice cannot long sustain such a senseless
    discrimination as to keep her on the “trike.” Tandems, of course, have
    an advantage in that the spectators can imagine that the man is doing
    all the work, which is generally about as true as that he does all the
    work when the family cook-stove is to be moved. No better illustration
    of the change of public opinion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span> in the matter of ladies’ cycle riding
    can be had, than in the little story told of Mr. James K. Starley,
    relating an event which is said to have occurred some years back on the
    streets of Coventry.</p>

  <p>This indefatigable genius of modern cycle art was pumping one of his
    early tricycles about the nooks and corners of Smithford, Hereford,
    Jordan Well, Little and Much Park, in the ancient city, amid the
    jeers and contemptuous sneers of the lusty silk weavers and cynical
    watchmakers; whereupon, being goaded to desperation by their taunts,
    he rose and exclaimed, “Why, the time will come when <em>ladies</em>
    will ride these things through your streets.” And ladies have long
    since ridden them through the streets of Coventry, as well as through
    the streets of many other towns, without compromising themselves or
    exciting undue comment, while the noble city of its birth has become
    the centre of modern cycledom.</p>

  <p>Social forms stick, often in spite of reason, and it may be a long time
    before it will be generally conceded that woman is in her legitimate
    sphere when perched upon the saddle of either a tricycle or bicycle,
    and if the lack of physical development continues to be one of the
    chief angelic characteristics of womankind in the mind of man, the
    time will be very remote indeed. But should it be discovered that less
    seraphic and more muscular tissue tends to make us all happier, then
    perhaps the time and doctors’ bills will be shorter.</p>

  <p>It is scarcely necessary to explain the construction of the bicycle
    intended for ladies’ use; suffice it to say, that a modern Rover Safety
    is used in which the backbone drops down to a level with the cranks,
    and the rider can step between the wheels and rise into the saddle by
    the pedal mount; not a difficult task, to judge from the grace and
    ease with which women accomplish the feat every day. It is not within
    the province of this book to pass encomiums upon any tribe, class,
    or individual, nor to compliment any sex, but it would be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span> heinous
    selfishness not to give the ladies some credit when it is so justly
    their due, as in this matter of the “bike.” When, on the streets of
    Washington, I see apparently timid girls make the pedal mount and move
    off so naturally and adroitly, the feeling of comparative superior
    physical dexterity, generally accredited to our sex, suffers a
    tremendous blow within me. In meeting these fair riders at their homes
    it is quite evident that they still retain the old-time graces and
    accomplishments common to the sex which men delight to honor. All this
    proves once for all and conclusively that some of the ideas entertained
    by mankind about womankind approach very nearly to the sphere of
    unmitigated humbug. Below will be found an energetic opinion of one of
    the ladies, as chronicled in the <cite>Bicycling World</cite>.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="center">“WOMEN, BICYCLES, AND DOCTORS.</p>

    <p>“Being a member of the L. A. W., I naturally see the <cite>World</cite>,
      and I have beside me a copy of your paper, in which I notice an
      article on ‘Why a woman should ride.’ I agree with the writer
      in that the ladies should ride, and from my own experience I
      have found it improves my ‘health and complexion’ very much. I
      have only been riding since last June, but I am stronger now,
      and enjoy living much better than I ever did before that time.
      The pains and the doctors have both gone, where, I don’t know
      and care less, so long as they <em>have</em> gone and so long as I
      still have my bicycle and can take my ride every day. It seems
      to give me life, and I feel the life-giving exhilaration born of
      this splendid exercise after I take a five-mile run around the
      city, or, perchance, the country. It is such sport to leave far
      behind fast-trotting horses, and men and women who are obliged to
      take the street-car every place they go. And what could be more
      amusing than to see some or all in a car rush to that side to see a
      ‘lady riding a bicycle.’ I sometimes get just a trifle angry when
      I hear some old feminine fuss and feathers say, ‘Oh, isn’t that
      <em>disgraceful</em> to see a <em>woman</em> riding a <em>man’s</em>
      bicycle!’ They, I suppose, never read the papers, as they would
      scarcely ever have time after working, worrying, and scolding their
      husbands (if they are lucky enough to have one). If they could just
      for an hour have the pleasure of riding as I do, I think the cross,
      fretful, and worrying fits would be few and far between. I could
      not do without my bicycle now. Sometimes when I have been out I
      come home laughing, and as I trot my five-year-old baby on my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span> knee,
      she sometimes says, ‘What’s happened that’s so funny? tell me.’ And
      as I take her little hands and we fly around the room together, I
      feel that no woman on earth is as happy as I. Even after riding
      ten miles I do not feel tired, but come home feeling better than
      when I started. My husband is very much pleased that I ride, and
      here I will mention that the advantage in having a lady’s Safety is
      that either can ride. I actually think sometimes that my bicycle
      is keeping me too young in actions, and that I am not growing old
      gracefully as I ought to.</p>

    <p>“Now I don’t want any one to infer from this that I am one of
      those strong-minded women that want to vote, and keep the men in
      petticoats. Oh, no, indeed! I am very well satisfied to let the men
      run this government as it is, or as it will be after March next.</p>

  <div class="subheadc">TANDEMS AND THE RATIONAL.</div>

  <p>The Tandem is a cycle in which two riders are mounted, one in front of
    the other, upon the same machine. We have the tandem tricycle, which is
    a two- or three-track machine on the tricycle principle, and the tandem
    bicycle, or single-track machine with two wheels.</p>

  <p>Of the tandem tricycle I shall have little to say, as my experience
    does not justify the attempt; also of the single tricycle I cannot give
    much of an account. This book does not pretend to treat of man-motor
    carriages so generally as to include all of the two- or three-track
    devices, nor of the three- or four-in-hand. Latterly remarkable records
    have been made on a “triplet,” and we hope this machine is all that
    is claimed for it. But there is too great a step from a single-track
    machine to the double or triple to treat of them all, so for the
    present I shall confine myself principally to that class in which the
    rider is maintained in an upright position by means of steering.</p>

  <p>The only single-track tandem which now bids fair to attain any
    conspicuous position is that built upon the Rover Safety principle,
    where two low wheels support two saddles and the rear wheel is made
    the driver by means of a series of sprocket-chains and cranks. No
    lever-motion machine, for two, of any pattern, has as yet made an
    appearance in the market. It is quite probable that the rear-driving
    tandem will acquire an enviable place in the sphere of cycling, and
    it certainly deserves to be enthusiastically welcomed among us. Very
    few cyclers care to take a spin all alone, and it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span> takes two riders
    at least to make company: why not then mount them sociably upon one
    vehicle? Surely the tandem method must steadily gain favor, and when
    it is finally and securely launched in our midst, we shall derive much
    pleasure from its use, and for touring it must become invaluable.
    No doubt a very little increase of weight of parts and cost can and
    will finally serve two happy cyclists. When this is accomplished it
    will take but little palaver to sell to touring parties at once,
    since one machine, even if of double weight, can be handled, in many
    cases, by two men much more easily than each can handle a light one
    alone. The Tandem takes up less space in a railroad car than two
    separate machines, and any store-room can be made to accommodate an
    increased number of saddles. The machines will mostly be made for each
    to accommodate both a lady and gentleman or two gentlemen, as may be
    preferred, and on this account they will, at some not far distant time,
    partially supplant single mounts. Some will also be made convertible;
    that is, capable of being divided into two single cycles. It is hardly
    probable that machines for more than two will ever become general, at
    least not for social riding; no better reason can be given than the old
    saw, “two’s company and three’s a crowd.” We do not, however, venture
    to prophesy positively about multiple riding (that is, more than
    double), since it has a start now, and there is no telling where it
    will end.</p>

  <p>In experimenting on tandem bicycles, I have found one difficulty
    which, so far, has been very serious; it is the tendency of switching
    between the riders; that is to say, the twist of the machine. It is
    difficult to make a frame strong enough to prevent this, since the
    rear end has to be kept perpendicular by means of a direct twist on
    a long backbone. Both riders cannot be uprighted as the same weight
    can be when it is all centred in one spot. It is the distribution of
    the weight more than the amount of it that causes the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span> trouble. It is
    well known that a man of two hundred and fifty pounds avoirdupois can
    ride without much trouble, but two men of one hundred and twenty-five
    pounds each, sitting two feet apart, will strain a single-track machine
    tremendously; this annoyance will not be finally escaped by means of
    mere strength of parts. Some novel arrangement of the wheels, saddles,
    or other mechanism will have to be called into play to modify the
    unsightly length of the present tandem bicycles, though it is not right
    to disparage them on account of it. Much objection has been raised to
    the “shape of the thing,” but since the advent of the Safety bicycles,
    appearance must take a second place to that which it held when we sat
    perched upon the noble old Ordinaries. If we must slip along the ground
    like beetles, let us not be too fastidious as to just how we look.</p>

  <p>Let the Tandem come on; and be received with open arms. Those of us who
    are a little weak want to make a combination with some flyers, to make
    up our deficiencies in scorching runs. If we can get on the rear seat
    and eat doughnuts part of the time, so much the better.</p>

  <h3>THE RATIONAL ORDINARY.</h3>

  <p>As the above term seems to be indigenous to England, and emanates
    indirectly from the fertile brain of the distinguished editor of the
    <cite>Cyclist</cite>, I append below a quotation from that journal by way of
    introduction to this subject.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="center">“THE FUTURE OF THE ORDINARY.</p>

    <p>“‘The Ordinary is doomed,’ we very frequently hear people say,
      but we are not of that opinion. True, it has ‘had its nose put
      out of joint’ by the Safety lately, but this only shows us the
      correctness of the opinions we have always held, and proves to us
      that, if the makers will only look after the safety and comfort
      of Ordinary riders a little more, the old love for the high wheel
      will return, and good business will result. In the introduction to
      the ‘Indispensable Bicyclists’ Hand-Book’ this year we say; ‘The
      Ordinary bicycle, for the young and active, is the most delightful
      form of cycle to possess, and the youth of England<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span> and other active
      nations will ever select it in preference to its perhaps safer,
      yet more cumbrous rival. To retain its hold as a touring machine,
      however, I feel certain that more attention must be paid to the
      comfort and comparative safety of the rider, and I hope to see in
      the near future a gradual inclination towards larger back wheels,
      more rake, longer cranks, and the addition of foot-rests, when the
      ordinary and original machine will, with common care, be equal in
      safety to any form of cycle extant.’...</p>

    <p>“This being so, we ask makers, in their own interests and in the
      interests of the Ordinary as a type, to deal with the matter and
      give attention to the points enumerated above. We are sure it
      would pay any maker, who has the proper facilities for doing so,
      to place a machine built as described vigorously on the market,
      and we hope next season to see it done, when we feel assured the
      rationally-built Ordinary will gradually work its way back into the
      public estimation.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>In spite of the laudatory notices of subsequent writers in the
    <cite>Cyclist</cite>, I am not disposed to treat this subject seriously. If
    not already consigned to oblivion, no doubt the ideas advanced in the
    foregoing quotation will be by the time this book reaches the reader;
    something must be said about it, however, since the importance of the
    question is now quite generally felt. To long cranks little objection
    can be made, but as to increased rake and large rear wheels, this is a
    thrust at the heart of all we have to admire in the Ordinary. We are
    willing to take the old mount with all its dangers, for the sake of
    its neat appearance and ease of running, but when we get back nearly
    off the large wheel; when we reach out to the end of a longer crank;
    when we get over and drag along after us a great ungainly rear wheel
    to wag about over the road; and lastly, when we strike at the life
    of easy steering, pray what have we left? Why not go back to the old
    bone-shaker, curl up like a sleeping chimpanzee and kick up in the air
    as we used to do, and be done with it? No! If we propose to stick to
    the old high perch, let us be men and take it as it has been perfected,
    neat and comfortable, with the rider upon the front wheel and within
    a reasonable distance of the point over his work. If not that, then
    let us gracefully accept our place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span> down among the dogs, and take the
    Safety, depending upon having so little else to attend to that we can
    kick off the festive canines and take up the time we would otherwise
    spend in patching up our skin with sticking plaster, in wiping off the
    accumulated dust from our machines.</p>

  <p>No man can edit a journal without making mistakes, and I shall
    probably find that books cannot be written without incurring the same
    liability, but for all this we cannot excuse the <cite>Rational</cite>.
    The more generally correct an editor is the more keenly we feel his
    freaks; so let this be my defence in noticing this little idiosyncratic
    perturbation of Mr. Sturmey’s otherwise infallible intellect.</p>

  <div class="subheadc">WORKMANSHIP IN CYCLES—ENGLISH AND AMERICAN MAKERS.</div>

  <p>Unfortunately, it is next to impossible to practically test the
    durability and general excellence of a wheel before purchasing.
    The buyer therefore has to depend upon his skill in judging of
    workmanship. It is impossible to give many set rules that would be of
    much assistance to a prospective buyer, but of one thing he can be
    reasonably certain,—if he finds a single poorly made or undeniably
    botched part, it is a valid cause for a rigid examination into all
    others. A first-class manufacturer is not liable to botch a single
    part, but if you find that he has done so, it is well to be very
    cautious in patronizing him. It is generally a safe plan to examine
    a machine that has been in use in order to judge of the durability
    of a maker’s work, though durability will generally accompany good
    workmanship and finish when new. A cheap quality of nickel-plating
    often gives the appearance of a good job, but it will peel and rust;
    and to prevent this good platers put on a coat of copper under the
    nickel as a base upon which to plate. It is difficult to determine
    in a new machine the amount of the nickel deposit, or whether it is
    upon a copper base; hence it will be seen that the maker’s work in the
    past is the only standard from which such matters can be judged. With
    enamel and paint it is much more easy to determine the quality, though
    a glossy surface is not necessarily a true gauge of good work. It is
    the finish of the under surfaces that takes the labor. A good job of
    painting is to my mind superior to enamel or japan, but it is attended
    with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span> considerable labor. In olden times, when paint was more common, a
    maker could be identified by the finish and striping of his machines;
    there was such a difference in the quality of the work. Now, however,
    since the dead-black japan rules the day, it is more difficult to judge
    between makers by the outward finish of their wares. There cannot be
    much difference in the amount of labor put upon the work by the various
    manufacturers, for the reason that a certain process has to be gone
    through before it can be done at all. <i lang="fr">À propos</i> of striping, it
    may be considered gaudy, but an artistic job sets off a machine as
    compared with a plain black now in vogue.</p>

  <p>The quality of rubber in the tire of a bicycle affords a splendid field
    for an expert; only those who have to use rubber in other connections
    realize the great differences in its quality. Rubber can be made
    absolutely useless by adulteration; and when we see how easily some
    tires cut, we cannot doubt that makers often sacrifice quality for
    the sake of price. Buyers should notice carefully the old tires of
    different makers, and see how they have stood the test.</p>

  <p>In the matter of quality of tubing of which machines are made there
    is little difficulty at present, as nearly all of the firms buy from
    one or the other of two great English factories, but when the industry
    of weldless tube-making becomes more disseminated, and small concerns
    with inadequate facilities enter the field, we can expect more trouble.
    About the brazing of the tubes it is utterly impossible to tell
    anything except from the way it stands.</p>

  <p>The screws and nuts about a machine should be provided with sharp,
    deep threads, and work easily though not loosely. A maker can
    almost always be judged by the kind of screws he cuts. The nuts and
    screw-heads should be case-hardened and be neat and square on the
    corners, and not rounded by the nickel polisher. In all cases where it
    is practicable some device<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span> for preventing the nuts from coming loose,
    or being entirely lost, is a great boon; this point will have to be
    looked after now since complicated machines are becoming more popular.
    The device generally used on the outer end of pedals should become more
    common, especially on tricycles, tandems, and chain Safeties, where
    there are so many parts. A good practical jam-nut has never yet been
    invented, and the cycle-builders are therefore not to blame for not
    having provided some means against loose nuts generally.</p>

  <p>In the matter of saddle and other springs, we are somewhat at a loss
    for a guide; there is not so much carelessness in quality of the steel
    used as in the tempering, and in this the buyer has again to rely on
    reputation and observance of other machines of the same make. The
    quality of leather often used in saddles is simply an insult to the
    judgment of the fraternity, and if we will go on in blindly taking any
    and everything that is offered, the imposition will continue. If buyers
    scrutinize closely, the makers will be proportionately careful, thus
    making it harder for unscrupulous tradesmen to foist poor work upon the
    market, an evil which has existed and will increase as the industry
    advances.</p>

  <h3>ABOUT ENGLISH AND AMERICAN MAKERS.</h3>

  <p>One of the most frequent questions asked by the would-be purchaser
    of either a two- or three-wheeler is, “What make shall I buy?” And
    before he settles down to a matter of comparison between individual
    firms he must first settle whether he will buy an English or American
    mount. This difficulty is, however, of less importance than he is apt
    to imagine, because, beyond all question, there are wheels good enough
    for any one made in either country. The chief trouble will lie in
    choosing between the different makers, especially if he concludes to
    try an English wheel. This,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span> as regards the English builders, arises
    from no general lack of capability among them, but it is simply due
    to the fact that the industry is so much more widely disseminated
    there than here. That is to say, there are so many more factories
    already established and new ones starting there, that, as a natural
    consequence, some incompetent people, with inadequate plant and
    machinery, will be certain to creep into the field. This is a temporary
    condition of affairs as between the two countries, for it will not be
    long until the same conditions will apply here in America. Now, the
    reader might infer that we condemn new and small makers, but by no
    means is this so. There are many small shops that turn out the best of
    work, some of them do not make the entire machine, but purchase many
    parts from manufacturers of specialties; but, as a general rule, it is
    a little safer to buy of a larger concern, that makes, as nearly as
    possible, the entire machine. This will apply in any line of business,
    especially if the buyer is not an expert in judging of the goods. On
    the other hand, there is this fact to contend against with the larger
    manufacturers,—when they make a mistake at all it is almost sure to
    be one comparable to the size of their business. In the small shops
    an error will be discovered more quickly, and, as a rule, will be
    rectified before many machines go on the market.</p>

  <p>In America the larger concerns are so vastly predominant over the
    small that the buyer has only to decide between articles of established
    reputation; the American factories do not seem to have ever been small.
    In a large majority of cases there are certain peculiarities about the
    machines which not only settle the matter <em>nationally</em>, but as
    to individual makers. Some little point at once takes the eye or the
    heart of the buyer, and that settles it all; and perhaps it is best it
    should be so. Nationally considered, the English have had much larger
    and more varied experience in the cycle industry than we have had;
    they have more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span> experts in the line and are nearer to the fountain head
    of supplies, particularly in regard to tubing, and no matter how soon
    we on this side may have tube-works, it will be some time before we
    can depend upon them. The English have taken advantage of their good
    fortune, and, together with the natural precedence in this art which
    we all agree has been allotted to them, they have gone ahead without
    the erroneous veneration generally felt in favor of their grandfather’s
    method, which has blinded them so often in their advancement in other
    arts. It was a marvellous sight to the writer to see a bicycle firm,
    flush with the times in all their work, in a factory almost nestling
    against other places devoted to making fusee watches with “Granddaddy
    winding-apparatuses,” making watch-cases by gradually punching them
    into a conical cast-iron cavity, cutting alleged screw bezels with a
    chaser in a lathe pulled back by a hickory spring, and such eocenic
    appliances.</p>

  <p>In Coventry there stood, wet and rusting in an old botanical
    conservatory, one of the finest of American watch-case tools, which
    some ambitious English watch-maker, in a fit of sanity, had taken over;
    but his men could not, or probably would not, use it. Yet a great cycle
    firm had just bought, and was using, one of the very finest Brown &amp;
    Sharp lathes, merely, I suppose, to make sure that no Yankee should
    get the better of them in tools. This is not an admission on their
    part that all English tools are immature affairs; they need not admit
    anything of the kind, for among the number of tons of cast iron in a
    twelve-inch screw lathe which you see in every cycle shop, a small
    part of one ton, at least, is fixed to do some work, and accurate work
    at that. It was a fortunate thing for our mother country in the cycle
    business that it was clogged by no fettering precedents or mediæval
    rules of mechanics. The English cycle-makers are abreast of the times
    in their line, and there is no better illustration of the total absence
    of all effect of surroundings upon this great industry than the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span> fact
    that the lightest cycles in the world are made with such ponderous
    tools. It must have been a great feat, in view of their proclivities
    for substantial machinery, to shave off the last superfluous ounce
    in a bicycle. In short, it has been impressed very forcibly on the
    writer’s mind that the famous Yankee ingenuity is simply unchained
    English genius. In our heated discussions as to whether the American
    manufacturer, with a higher rate of wages, could hold his own against
    the English without a discriminating tariff duty, there may be two
    sides in regard to watch-making and some other industries, but when
    applied to cycles it is nonsense to suppose that we could compete.</p>

  <p>As to American machines, that which would strike us as remarkable in
    the English would be, to a large extent, natural to our institutions;
    that all machine parts should be accurately made and be interchangeable
    would be taken for granted when coming from one of our factories,
    but it is a little odd to find it approached by others. The absolute
    regularity and similarity with which work is turned out by us is
    sometimes an objection; if a part is too hard or brittle, or in any
    way bad in its construction and form, a part for the same purpose,
    from the same factory, will be sure to be just like the one you want
    to replace; in fact, if you have one bad part, depend upon it there
    have been thousands made just like it, and you will be pretty certain
    to get one of them. It is generally conceded that the American maker
    is more careful to test his new plans before placing the product upon
    the market; anyhow, since the customer in this country is able to get
    to head-quarters more easily with his complaint, he generally favors
    buying at home, though it is often a very close contest in his mind
    just what to do.</p>

  <p>However a cyclist may feel in regard to this question of English
    or American machines, it would be best in the long run to settle the
    question entirely upon the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span> merits and quality of the work. It is a bad
    plan to implicitly take the word of a salesman regardless of one’s own
    judgment. The variety of machines has become so great that it is more
    than likely the customer will generally have to buy from the maker
    who has adopted the special style of machine the buyer is determined
    to have. But let this not deter him from insisting on a high grade of
    workmanship and excellence of material.</p>

  <div class="subheadc">CRANKS AND LEVERS AND TANGENT SPOKES.</div>

  <p>The subject of cranks and levers has been touched upon from a
    philosophical stand-point, but an ingenious squib in a maker’s
    catalogue on the subject has suggested the propriety of treating its
    mechanical features more fully. The squib referred to runs as follows:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="center">“CRANKS VS. LEVERS.</p>

    <p>“The question of a motive power for cycles is as old as the
      first idea of wheel riding. Inventors, after having persistently
      tried and abandoned every other known motor,—steam, electricity,
      etc.,—have made every effort to discover the best way of applying
      leg-power.</p>

    <p>“While nine-tenths of the cycles have always been driven by cranks,
      in a few cases the attempt has been made to show that power could
      absolutely be created by the use of levers, and that if the power
      could be applied on one side only of the axle, avoiding the return
      stroke of a crank, the result would equal a man’s lifting himself
      over a fence by his boot-straps.</p>

    <p>“In their eager pursuit of this one idea its advocates have lost
      sight of the fact that the question is of the economical use of
      the power we have, and that it is as impossible to <em>create</em>
      a power as to overcome the laws of gravitation. For hundreds of
      years the machinery of the world, practically speaking, has been
      driven by cranks. In this fact we have the testimony of the highest
      mechanical genius the world has known.</p>

    <p>“Engineers agree that the crank is the only economical method of
      applying power—that it transmits to the driving shaft ninety-nine
      per cent. of the power applied. In no class of machinery except
      cycles is the attempt made to use levers where cranks could be used.</p>

    <p>“Careful experiments have shown that the use of a lever is
      misleading, in that, while power can be converted into speed and
      speed into power, the development of either is at the expense of
      the other. It is at once evident that with levers we have more
      friction, more weight, and more complication than with cranks, and
      that absolutely more power is required, as the springs which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span> are
      used to return the levers must be forced down at the expenditure
      of power which should be applied to the propulsion of the machine.
      Several years ago lever-power was tried in England on bicycles and
      tricycles and extensively introduced, but has been so generally
      abandoned that there is to-day no machine of importance so driven.
      The worst feature of the lever action, however, is that the
      movement of the foot does not become automatic, as is the case
      in the use of the crank. There is absence of regularity, and a
      consequent loss of momentum. A rotary motion is more natural to
      the feet, being more like walking, while a lever motion is like
      treading water while swimming, or like constantly climbing up
      stairs. Not only does the mechanical use of the legs require a
      regular movement, but it is better to use always the same length of
      crank, never varying the throw.</p>

    <p>“A special set of muscles can be trained to such work as the use
      of the lever action; but such development is abnormal and at the
      expense of other parts of the body.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>There is little doubt in the minds of reasonable people that a good
    machine can be made either with cranks or levers; and this possibility
    makes it an interesting point in cycle discussion. It is hardly fair,
    however, to hold a maker responsible for matter written for the
    purpose of advertising his wares, nor do I wish to do so. The article
    above quoted puts, in unique form, the opinions of a large class of
    observers, and for that reason it is given here. I take up the lever
    side of the question simply because there is more to talk about on that
    side, and also perhaps for the reason that I have had large experience
    at considerable cost in experimenting on different forms of levers.</p>

  <p>Some of the remarks about “creating power” are true, but might be
    applied equally well to some of our crank theorists.</p>

  <p>To say that the machinery of the world is driven by cranks, is hardly
    tenable; even though the engine generally has a crank. But now, since
    we must reduce our comparisons down to the human motor, in combination
    with the crank of a bicycle, let us say the pitman rod represents the
    man’s leg. This rod has to push and pull, which a man cannot do with
    one leg; but for this you say he has two legs; admitting, then,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span> that
    two legs represent the pitman, we are still out a fly-wheel and an
    evenly-running resistance. (See <a href="#CONNECTING_LINK">chapter on “Connecting Link.”</a>)</p>

  <p>A great deal of the power of machinery is transmitted through pulleys
    and belts; now I take it that this is much more similar to some of the
    drum and lever machines than to a simple crank. There is, however, a
    form of lever and crank combined, of which I have spoken elsewhere,
    that is really worse than any simple form of either, but we have just
    as much right to say the crank ought to make it good as to say the
    lever makes it bad; if the crank is such a great cure for all evils,
    as the maker quoted seems to imply, it ought not be so bad in any
    combination.</p>

  <p>There is no loss of power in pushing down a spring if it is only just
    strong enough to lift the leg, since the leg would otherwise have to
    be lifted by the expenditure of muscular energy. In using a spring
    we press down with a little more weight than is required to run the
    machine, so that a storage of power is the result which is given out
    in lifting the leg. In fact this is done to some extent in the crank
    machines; the rider not only puts enough power on each crank to turn
    the wheel, but also enough to lift the other leg; this is true at least
    when the rider is quite tired. Examples are known wherein a racer on
    long distances could no longer lift his legs, even with the aid of a
    spring, though at the same time, he still had strength enough left to
    propel the machine. In fine, this difference between the crank and
    spring lever is that in the former, a little extra power is exerted to
    lift the <em>other</em> leg, while, in the latter, energy is stored to be
    used in raising the <em>same</em> leg.</p>

  <p>In a perfectly fresh man I have found, by the registers of the
    cyclograph, that the rider lifts all weight from a returning crank, but
    this does not happen when he becomes tired. Evidently, if the spring is
    strong enough to more than lift the leg, a loss of power will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span> result,
    since the rider would have to hold it in check even in coming up in
    order to keep it from stopping with a bang, as is sometimes noticed
    when he jumps from a treadle machine. The winding and unwinding of the
    spring involves no loss of power except in heat incident to motion and
    imperfect elasticity, which is quite small. This loss from heat within
    the molecular structure, I am constrained to think, is not what is
    popularly meant by loss of power in springs.</p>

  <p>Coming back to our quotation, true, in England levers have been tried
    and expunged. A prominent American, I believe, assisted some little in
    enlightening our too susceptible English brethren on the subject, yet
    some attempts have been made with them in this country which no fair
    person can call unsuccessful.</p>

  <p>A little printer’s ink will answer the last sentence of our quotation.
    Simply change the words “lever-action,” and substitute “cranks,” and
    you will have the following: “A special set of muscles can be trained
    to such work as the use of cranks, but such development is abnormal and
    at the expense of other parts of the body.” So the reader can see how
    a little slip in the type would have changed the whole argument. This
    discussion could be continued with great interest to both sides if we
    could only find in some maker’s catalogue of lever machines an attempt
    to “down” the crank machine on general principles. As it is, it must
    close for lack of antagonism in so far as broad principle goes.</p>

  <p>As to the construction of crank machines, the subject is so familiar
    to every one, and the device is so simple, that it is impossible to
    write much of an essay on it. With regard to levers, however, the
    subject is inexhaustible. The most salient features claimed for the
    clutch machines now in the market are, first, non-dead centre,—that
    is, even, continuous power; second, entire rest of the legs when
    power is not required. The objections are chiefly, first, insecurity
    and entire<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span> dependence on the brake found in the absence of all back
    pedalling; second, non-support of the legs, springs being insufficient
    to sustain their weight. To the above objections appertaining to the
    lever and clutch machine, a third may be added,—viz., the complexity
    of parts, liability to breakage, and danger of accidents therefrom. At
    one time the advantage of safety was found in the clutch machine almost
    exclusively, but at the present time we have complete safety elements
    in certain forms of crank-wheels.</p>

  <p>Much difficulty has been experienced by makers of lever cycles in
    finding a suitable clutching device, a difficulty with which most
    of the experience the writer has had is concerned. In conducting
    experiments in this line I have found that the rattle of the old
    ratchet was annoying, and it was quite a problem in my mind why makers
    used them; but any one who undertakes to make a bicycle clutch will
    soon discover the reason, though at what cost “deponent sayeth not.”
    A neophyte in the bicycle experimenting ranks might justly suppose
    that the matter of clutches is a well-developed art in mechanics; to a
    certain extent it is, but not in the direction he will need. Clutches
    may be divided into three classes,—first, the common ratchet and pawl,
    either spring or gravity; second, the ratchet and friction pawl; third,
    surface-friction clutches proper. The first two grip on corrugated
    surfaces, the last on a perfectly plain or smooth surface. The first
    class rattles according to the pressure on the pawl or the weight of
    the same, and also to the amount of drop. The second class rattles
    only under certain conditions; that is, when both ratchet and pawl are
    in motion in the same direction, one moving a little faster than the
    other. The third class is entirely noiseless. Let us pass over the
    first class, as being familiar to everybody. The second class is not so
    well known and has never been used in any of the arts in this country
    so far as I know, except as recently applied to bicycles. This clutch
    is very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span> similar in appearance to a regular ratchet, the difference
    being that in the former the pawl is held out of contact by friction
    against some of the moving parts, and when the motion is reversed the
    friction in a certain direction throws the pawl into action. A good
    mechanic would have hardly conceded such an arrangement as practicable
    in any machine, much less in a bicycle, for the reason that when the
    motion is reversed the pawl plunges into the teeth with so much force
    that damage would be supposed to result. Several patents are registered
    in England upon the noiseless ratchet; they are all alike in general
    principle, but it is due to the energy of an American maker that it has
    been made a success in cycle construction, and I am inclined to think
    it is the first time such a ratchet has ever been used to any extent in
    any kind of machinery.</p>

  </figure>

  <p>As to the third class of clutches, much of interest can be said for
    the benefit of those particularly concerned. “A friction clutch” to
    mechanics is a familiar term, since the name is applied to all pulley
    clutches, that grip on a smooth surface. Many of these clutches are a
    success for the purpose for which they are intended. The most common
    form used on machines where the requirements are similar to those of a
    cycle, is the “Roller.” The cycle experimenter nearly always strikes
    upon this clutch first, and with sufficiently good reason. It has
    been adopted in many arts, and is used in England<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span> upon tricycles in
    combination with cranks, with moderate success, but just here allow
    me to call attention to a cardinal difference in the requirements
    of a clutch as used on crank tricycles and successfully in the arts
    heretofore. In the crank-clutch cycles the clutch is used for the
    purpose of detaching the cranks from the spindle when the machine
    requires no driving, as in running down grade, but when once the clutch
    is gripped, it remains so till further power ceases to be required.
    Now, this is also just the action of all belt-pulley clutches, and
    between such action and that required in a lever-clutch cycle the
    difference is exceedingly conspicuous. In the crank-clutch cycle, as
    in other uses, the immediate solid grip is a matter of little concern;
    if a half turn of the parts takes place before clutching, it does
    little harm, since it is so small a fraction of the entire number of
    revolutions to be made before the grip is released. But if a grip is to
    be taken at every down stroke of the foot, as in a lever-clutch cycle,
    the least slip or lost motion is fatal.</p>

  <p>This incessant clutching action, together with the great weight the
    parts have to sustain, and the repeated concussion of one piece upon
    another under this weight, makes up a combination of disturbing
    elements which will cause mischief against which it is almost
    impossible to provide.</p>

  <p>In a form of roller-clutch I have tried, the inner frame or carrier is
    made loose upon a spindle.</p>

  <p>In the drawing herewith annexed we have first a spindle in the centre,
    then a little open space around it, and then the clutch frame <i>b
    b</i>, which is connected loosely, not rigidly, to the drum. By this
    arrangement the pressure is distributed evenly upon the three rollers
    <i>d</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>d</i>, outwardly at three points against the
    casing, and in no event is the work done by a single roller. This
    device worked as well as any of this class I have tried; but the
    patterns are for sale at a very reasonable price. The main trouble I
    found in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span> this contrivance and all other roller clutches was, that the
    great pressure disintegrated the oil, making a paste that would cause
    the rollers to slip in spite of everything.</p>

  <p>If it were not that another American, a cycle-maker, has apparently
    made a success of a roller-clutch, I should be tempted to warn all
    experimenters against it as a thing that “stingeth like a serpent and
    biteth like an adder.”</p>

  <p>Under a bench in a shop not far from the geographical centre of
    England may still be found about a bushel of friction-clutches of
    various and ingenious forms, which future historians in the art will
    find very interesting. Should any one wish to enter the arena as a
    searcher for the true friction-clutch, let him first examine these
    specimens, and he will start several years ahead. The nearest approach
    to a success which the writer has fallen upon is illustrated below for
    the purpose of helping those who may wish to carry on the search, or
    experiment in clutch-cycles,—if any should think it worth while in view
    of the alleged success of the American above referred to. The clutch
    illustrated below was contrived by a fellow-laborer in the field.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span> The
    drawing represents the device in a crude form; some improvements having
    been necessary to complete it.</p>

    revolve, in relation to each other, in one direction only.</p>

  <p>For those who wish to study this question more minutely, Kempe, on
    link motion, will be found a valuable work in connection with the
    construction of levers in any art, when it is desired to obtain a
    motion in a straight line from an oscillating or circular.</p>

  <p>In the way of conclusion, reverting to the possibilities of direct
    application of these remarks to the actual purchase and use of cycles,
    I wish to say, in regard to the mechanical difficulties in this
    matter of lever and clutch machines, that so long as the use of oil
    is necessary, I have very grave doubts if a thoroughly satisfactory,
    noiseless friction-clutch for use on cycles will ever be invented.</p>

  <h3>TANGENT VS. DIRECT SPOKES.</h3>

  <p>The subject of Tangent <i>vs.</i> Direct Spokes, or Direct vs. Partial
    Tangent, is one on which so much has been written and said within
    the last few years that it is probably well understood in the main
    by all enthusiastic wheelmen, but a few points may not come amiss to
    the beginner. In the first place, there is no such thing as partial
    tangency. A tangent spoke is tangent, and that is all there is about
    it. A tangent is a definite thing, and means a line normal to a radius
    at the circumference; at least, we can accept this definition as well
    enough suited to the cycle art. And, in speaking of tangency, we ought
    rather to say tangent hub than tangent wheel, since the spokes are not
    tangent to the rim of the wheel, but to the hub. All cyclists know very
    well, nevertheless, what is meant by partial tangency in the cycle
    art, and I will therefore use the term. If a long spoke went straight
    from one point in the rim to another nearly opposite, and just touched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
    the outside circumference of the hub in one place, it would make two
    purely tangent spokes. (See cut.) As, for instance, <i>a b</i> and
    <i>c d</i> make all together four spokes, <i>a f</i>, <i>b f</i>,
    <i>d e</i>, and <i>c e</i>. If a spoke runs from any point, <i>a</i>,
    <i>c</i>, <i>b</i>, or <i>d</i>, to any point on the circumference of
    the hub between <i>f</i> and <i>e</i>, it will not be a full tangent
    spoke. The distinctive characteristic of a full tangent spoke is that,
    when the force tending to revolve the wheel is applied, it pulls from
    the point on the hub which would recede most rapidly from that point
    in the rim to which the other end of the spoke is affixed. Hence, the
    common expression that “a tangent hub gives a direct end-pull on the
    spokes;” but so does any other hub, if the spoke is swivelled into it.
    With a direct spoke screwed into the hub, the weight of the man is
    sustained by a direct end-pull, and a slight power is transmitted to
    the rim by the resistance to flexure or bending in the spoke tending to
    revolve the wheel, and it will be found in practice that any hub with a
    direct spoke will turn independently of the rim far enough to increase
    the distance slightly between the ends of the spokes so as to really
    make an end-pull as in the tangent spoke, but evidently the hub must
    revolve a great way in order to increase the length a very little. Here
    comes in the advantage of the tangent spoke, for, in order to turn the
    hub within the rim, the spoke has to stretch an amount equal to the
    distance a point on the circumference of the hub moves. To represent
    this in popular terms, if the hub turns one-eighth of an inch, the
    spoke has to stretch that amount if tangent, whereas the necessary
    increase in length of the direct spoke is almost imperceptible.</p>

  <figure class="figcenter illowp57" id="i_165">
    <img src="images/i_165.jpg" alt="">
    <figcaption>Tangent spokes.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>One point must not be forgotten in this matter, which redounds to
    the credit of the absolute direct spoke. It is that the driving
    strain passes through every spoke from the hub to the rim, whereas,
    in a tangent or partial tangent spoke, the strain is resisted by only
    one-half of the entire number. This defect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span> is partially remedied by the
    late plan of soldering the spokes together at the points of crossing,
    this binding together being what really makes the tangent spokes so
    strong in resisting buckling, to which they were very liable before
    the soldering process was used. I am inclined to think that the midway
    or partial tangent hubs are the best, as they seem to combine all of
    the possible advantages, but the plan of crossing the spokes just once
    is, in the light of my experience, very bad, as it seems to combine
    the faults of both with the advantages of neither; they should be more
    nearly full tangent than direct if varied from the midway position at
    all. The small eighteen- or even thirty-inch wheel is good enough, if
    well made, with either direct or tangent hubs, especially in the one
    not used as a driver.</p>

    <img src="images/i_167.jpg" alt="">
    <figcaption>Old bone-shaker wheel.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>The soldering of the spokes together, and other difficulties in the
    way of screwing them into tangent hubs, has led makers to adopt the
    plan of screwing them into the rim; this seems unavoidable, but is not
    very desirable, if for no other reason than that the wheel getting wet,
    the screw threads are apt to rust off and strip. With brass, aluminum,
    or bronze nipples,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span> however, this difficulty can be to a great extent
    overcome.</p>

  <p>Tangent wheels are as old as the industry of cycling. Starley, of
    Coventry, is said to have experimented and shown, many years ago,
    that a tangent wheel with silk spokes would resist the revolving
    strain on the hub equal to a direct wire spoke, and the <cite>Scientific
    American</cite> gave an illustration of a tangent hub in their issue of
    September 1, 1877.</p>

  <p>The cross bar in the old bone-shaker made practically two tangent
    spokes, and pulled from the rim, so to speak, as will be noticed in our
    essay on hobbies.</p>

  <p>The cycle art has developed the use of antifriction, or, we might say,
    rolling-friction bearings, to an extent never before attained; these
    bearings are in the form of balls and rollers; the former are made in
    several styles and the latter in at least two, but all are more or less
    old in the arts.</p>

    <figcaption>1861. Ball-bearing patent.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>The first prominent patent in the American office, upon balls or
    rollers, is dated June 18, 1861, No. 32,604. There are some three
    hundred drawings of roller and ball-bearing patents on file at the
    United States office; this, however, does not represent the entire
    number issued. All of the more recent patents are substantially
    modifications of former patterns, such as No. 29,570, 1860; 37,765,
    1863; 58,739, 1866; 63,609, 1867; 82,665, 1868; 113,867, 1871; 202,271,
    1878, and Peter’s, November 20, 1877, No. 197,289.</p>

  <p>One of the most useful variations and the one best adapted to the
    cycle art, is the lateral adjusting bearing of this style.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“What I claim, and wish protected by Letters Patent is,—</p>

    <p>“In bearings for bicycles, tricycles, or carriages, the combination of
      hardened conical or curved surfaces, hardened spherical balls, and the
      means, substantially as shown and described, of adjusting or setting up
      the parts, for the purposes set forth.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span></p>

  <p>Other forms, such as the disk pattern with an annular groove upon its
    face, have their special uses.</p>

  <p>As to friction, ball-bearings may be said to reduce this to nothing,
    since in mathematical calculations, rolling friction on hard surfaces
    is usually neglected, as compared with sliding friction. In actual
    practice this would not quite hold good, since oil and dirt will make
    a difference. The balls, in the ordinary bearings in the market, roll
    upon conical, spherical, or cylindrical surfaces. In either of the last
    two cases the radius of curvature of the box is so much greater than
    that of the ball that the effect is the same as upon the cone, and in
    all cases where a bearing is well constructed the action is the same as
    that of a ball rolling upon a flat surface. True, some friction results
    from the contact of the balls with each other, but as there is no force
    driving them together, it is very slight.</p>

    <img src="images/i_171.jpg" alt="">
    <figcaption>Annular, ball-bearing.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>So long as the bearings are new and properly made, each ball touches
    and rolls along what may be considered a mathematical line, and there
    is, in fact, no friction worthy of consideration. Nevertheless there
    is some, and in time a small groove is worn, or rolled, into the
    bearing, which groove just fits the ball. The friction is greater now
    than before, and increases with the deepening groove until, finally,
    when the depth of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span> the groove equals the radius of the ball, the
    friction reaches its maximum and would be at that time nearly equal to
    one-fourth of the amount of friction engendered if the ball actually
    slid in the groove. The ball would then roll on lines along the groove
    through points <i>c</i>, <i>c</i> thirty-eight and one-fourth degrees
    around from <i>E</i> towards <i>D</i>, as shown in the annexed diagram.
    (<a href="#i_172">Fig. 1</a>.)</p>

  <p>The reader can form a tolerably clear idea of the amount of friction
    caused by the ball sliding without rolling; let this then be the unit.
    Also let the radius of the ball be the unit depth of groove. The

  <p>To what is this friction due? Look at this diagram (<a href="#i_173">Fig. 2</a>),
    representing a transverse section of the groove and ball.</p>

  <figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="i_173">

    <img src="images/i_173.jpg" alt="">
    <figcaption>Transverse section groove and ball.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>Is it not evident that the ball really rolls on two parallel lines
    in the groove somewhere between <i>D</i> and <i>E</i>, say the lines
    through <i>c c</i> perpendicular to the plane of the paper? This
    granted, it follows that points on the ball-surface touching the groove
    above <i>c</i> are going faster, while those touching below <i>c</i>
    are going slower than points touching at <i>c</i>. Hence, no wonder
    there is friction. The position of <i>c c</i> is such that the sum
    of the moments of friction above <i>c c</i> balances the sum of the
    moments of friction below <i>c c</i>. Take axes <i>O X</i>, <i>O Y</i>,
    as indicated; let the <i>x</i> of <i>c c</i> be <i>a</i>, and that of
    <i>D D</i>, <i>b</i>; put <i>d s</i> for an element of arc, and let
    <i>A</i> be the angle between the radius to <i>d s</i> and <i>O Y</i>.
    Then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span> the friction on <i>d s</i> is proportional to <i>d s</i> cos
    <i>A</i> = <i>d y</i>, and its moment about <i>c c</i> is proportional
    to <i>d y</i> (<i>x − a</i>), or, <i>d y</i> (<i>a − x</i>), according
    as <i>d s</i> is above or below <i>c c</i>.</p>

  <p>Therefore, <span class="int">∫</span><span class="integral"><sup>√<span class="sqrt3">1

    (<i>a − x</i>) <i>dy</i><sub>√<span class="sqrt3">1 − <i>a</i><sup>2</sup></span></sub></span></p>

  <p>The ball’s radius being unity, the solution of the above equation is,—</p>

  <p class="noindent">which determines <i>a</i> for all values of <i>b</i>; that is,

    <i>d s</i> was proportional to the friction upon itself. Of course, we meant that it was proportional so long as <i>a</i>
    remained constant. In terms of the unit given at the beginning of this

  <p>As to the weight balls can safely carry in any bearing, below will
    be found results of experiments and calculations made by Professor
    Robinson, of the Ohio State University. This article is the result of
    careful, exhaustive work, and I am under great obligations for the
    privilege of introducing it here, as it has never before been in print.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“To find the load which a single hardened steel ball will safely
      carry in any ball-bearing, either when running between two flat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
      surfaces or between two equally grooved surfaces of hardened steel,
      in each case the following formula may be applied,—viz.: Load in
      pounds =&nbsp;190&nbsp;<i>d</i><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;√<span class="sqrt2">1&nbsp;+&nbsp;<span class="frac"><sup><i>d</i></sup><sub><i>d′&nbsp;−&nbsp;d</i></sub></span></span>, where
      <i>d</i> equals the diameter of the ball in inches and <i>d′</i>
      equals the diameter of the groove in which the ball runs, either
      top or bottom. For flat surfaces, for top and bottom bearing
      of ball <i>d’</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;∞ and <span class="frac"><sup><i>d</i></sup><sub><i>d′&nbsp;−&nbsp;d</i></sub></span>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0,
      so that, for a ball between hardened flat plates, Load&nbsp;=&nbsp;190&nbsp;<i>d</i><sup>2</sup>.
      For <i>n</i> balls in a nest, all in equally
      fair bearings, the load equals
      <i>n</i>&nbsp;190&nbsp;<i>d</i><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;√<span class="sqrt2">1&nbsp;+&nbsp;<span class="frac"><sup><i>d</i></sup><sub><i>d′&nbsp;−&nbsp;d</i></sub></span></span>;
      for example, a one-inch ball between flat
      surfaces will carry one hundred and ninety pounds safely.</p>

    <p>“Again a one-half-inch ball will carry <span class="frac"><sup>190</sup><sub>4</sub></span>&nbsp;=&nbsp;47.5 pounds; and
      again a one-inch ball in a groove of one and one-eighth-inch
      diameter top and bottom will carry
      190 √<span class="sqrt4">1&nbsp;+&nbsp;<span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><sub>1′&nbsp;(8&nbsp;−&nbsp;1)</sub></span></span>&nbsp;=&nbsp;570
      pounds. So that there is great advantage in supplying grooves
      for the balls to run in. Again, suppose the ball be one inch and
      the grooves one and one-eightieth inches in diameter; then the
      load equals seventeen hundred and ten pounds. Again, if the ball
      is one-half-inch diameter, and the groove nine-sixteenths-inch
      diameter, the load equals 142.5 pounds, etc.</p>

    <p>“Hundreds of experiments in all were made on this subject, and
      the above formula deduced by theory was found to agree almost
      exactly with the experimental results for hardened steel for balls
      and track for same. When a much greater load than the above is
      attempted to be carried, the balls will indent a groove of their
      own until the necessary bearing surface is obtained.</p>

    <p>“I am not aware that the coefficient of friction for ball-bearings
      is definitely known. Experiments made with the Lick telescope, in
      which the weights of some parts had to be guessed at, gives .00175
      for the value of friction coefficient for one-inch balls; but
      this, though the best I have, is not a reliable figure. It is for
      hardened steel on hardened steel.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Mr. Robinson here shows an advantage in the groove so far as capacity
    for resisting strain is concerned, but he would hardly construct a
    ball-bearing with grooves fitting the balls after a careful perusal of
    our section on grooves and friction.</p>

  <p>As to <em>ball-heads</em> to bicycles, they have been highly recommended
    by a few makers and much admired by some riders. As before said, the
    balancing of the bicycle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span> is accomplished by means of the steering
    apparatus, and the easier the head swivels the less work the rider
    has to do to effect his object. If simple steering—that is, changing
    the general course of the rider’s progress—happened to be all for
    which the head is swivelled, it would make little difference whether
    it moved very easily or not; nay, it would be better to have it move
    a little stiff, since it would then stay in place. But when it comes
    to balancing, the head is constantly moving, and every resistance is
    work to be overcome by the rider’s muscular exertion. To say that a
    head cannot swivel too easily, would be a valid axiom in the art of
    balancing; hence a ball-head could do no harm, and might do some good.
    In the Rover or Safety pattern, ball-heads are quite common and are
    rather a valuable acquisition, especially in the telescope. In the
    Stanley head, however, it is very questionable whether the advantage
    gained is sufficient to justify the extra complication and weight of
    the parts. Conical heads can be, and are, made to work so smoothly
    and the amount of motion is so small that the same question in regard
    to friction does not apply as in the case of other bearings about the
    machine. It is the opinion of the writer that every other part about a
    wheel should be about perfect, and of the very highest grade, before
    the question of ball-heads should be considered at all.</p>

  <p>In regard to the patents on, and general use of, ball-bearings in
    cycles, I think the necessity of using the prominent lateral adjusting
    bearings is really not so absolute as many suppose; of course this is
    the most artistic form and the most easily-made pattern of all, and is
    in every way adapted to cycle use; but it would not be policy to throw
    aside any other advantage in a wheel to gain the lateral adjustment
    in the bearings. There are some other styles of ball-bearing boxes
    which answer the purpose very well, the chief difficulty being that a
    greater amount of work is necessary for their adjustment. If the boxes
    are split in a plane through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span> the geometric axis of the axle, they will
    be slightly out of round after adjusting, but when it is taken into
    consideration that the weight is all on one side or, as in a bicycle,
    on the top, the fault will not be noticeable; it is more serious when
    the boxes revolve than when they are stationary.</p>

  <p>The patents now existing on lateral adjusting bearings have caused
    many attempts at other methods of taking up the wear. The validity
    of these patents is questioned by many, and considerable litigation
    has been the result, though in many cases makers prefer to use other
    devices to running the chance of a law suit. The happy medium adopted
    by others is to pay the royalty demanded; this is, perhaps, the best
    course to pursue if the said royalty is not made burdensome. Every
    maker, however, should assure himself, by special examination, if his
    particular bearing really infringes any patent before paying; the
    fact of it being a ball-bearing with a lateral adjustment is not an
    incontrovertible reason that it should infringe, since both of these
    elements are, in themselves, old. It is only a special ball-bearing
    with a special adjustment that is patented. Unhappily, however, the
    special adjustment is a screw. How the patent will stand, time alone
    can tell; its validity is certainly questionable.</p>

  <p>A word here in regard to paying royalties in general. Makers are too
    scrupulously averse to such payments, even when small, and buyers have
    the idea that any one who pays a royalty is naturally working at a
    disadvantage. This is not necessarily the case. Some would save more by
    the use of an ingenious machine for making the parts than several times
    the royalty often amounts to. In the manufacturing business there are
    so many ways of saving and losing money, that unless a careful watch is
    kept all round the little matter of royalty on some one part will fall
    into insignificance as compared with other leaks.</p>

  <p>The advertisement of a maker that he pays no royalty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span> gives us but
    little assurance that he can make a better machine for less money.
    When a patent is evaded by slight changes, such, for instance, as the
    increase or decrease of an inch in the diameter of a wheel, it shows
    not so much a great shrewdness on the part of the pirate as a frailty
    in the patent; this sort of evasion of royalties is considered to be
    perfectly legitimate, however, and means that either the attorney who
    took out the patent was incompetent, or that there was but little
    invention to be claimed.</p>

  <h3>ROLLERS.</h3>

  <p>Theoretically there is less friction in roller- than in ball-bearings,
    as there need be no sliding action whatever in the former if well
    made. But in actual practice no bearing can be made in which there is
    no tendency of the rollers to run together; and if we place them in a
    frame to hold them apart we shall have about as much friction as when
    they rub against one another. The most perfect plan is to place a small
    roller between each of the larger; with this arrangement the friction
    is practically nothing. The action of rollers upon the boxes is always
    a pure rolling friction, which cannot be the case with balls after the
    slightest groove is worn in the casing.</p>

  <p>One reason for rollers being little used is that they tend to work out
    of line with the axle and box, which causes some ends to get a little
    in advance of the others, when they can no longer work perfectly. For
    an oscillating bearing,—that is, one that goes backward and forward,
    instead of continually around,—I have found rollers very good, since
    they cannot get much out of line; even when the bearing is a little
    imperfect, the rollers cannot multiply the imperfection, as they will
    in one that keeps going on in the same direction. The other great fault
    of the roller is its non-adjustability, although this can be rectified
    in the following way:</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span></p>

  <figure class="figcenter illowp95" id="i_179">
    <img src="images/i_179.jpg" alt="">
    <figcaption>Roller construction.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>The above cut shows a bearing and the construction lines that must
    be followed in its manufacture. The taper of the axle, roller, and
    box must all meet in a point, as at <i>a</i>; this arrangement is
    evident. The roller must be kept in proper position and roll around
    the large end in the same number of turns as the small end; hence
    the circumference of the small end of the roller must bear the same
    relation to the circumference of the larger as the relative ends of
    the axle and box bear to each other. The geometrical conditions are
    as follows: π being the relation of circumference to the diameter,
    referring to the diagram, we have <i>b c : f g :: c d :
    g h :: b e : f i</i>; hence π <i>b c :</i> π <i>f g ::</i>
    π <i>c d :</i> π <i>g h ::</i> π <i>b e :</i> π <i>f i</i>. Now, by virtue of the
    last formula, when the axle or box is revolved, each end of the roller
    will travel through exactly the same number of degrees around the axle
    and in the box, wherefore the axle rollers and box all keep straight.</p>

    <p>“We really thought that we were going to pass over a period of
      three months without having to chronicle the discovery (?) of
      a method of producing aluminum at a cost of not more than that
      of first-class steel. The periodical inventor has appeared, and
      this time he hails from Melrose, Mass., and his name is Washburn.

  </blockquote>

  <p>Inventors do little harm in periodically making cheap aluminum or
    increasing its strength without adding to its gravity, but when a
    large corporation is started, as was done some months ago, with a
    lot of money and aluminum medals issued, the same being made out of
    copper, then the matter becomes serious. Probably, next to the hobby
    of separating water and creating enormous power thereby, the aluminum
    hobby holds undisputed sway. But as there really is something of
    interest to cyclists and cycle makers in the subject, there seems a
    need to touch upon it. Among the articles in the manufacture of which
    aluminum can be satisfactorily used we find in the catalogue of a
    well-known smelting firm mention made of bicycles, tricycles, etc. The
    idea exists in the minds of many that a bicycle made from pure aluminum
    would be a practical machine and much lighter than one of steel. This
    notion arises from the fact that aluminum in the pure state has a
    specific gravity of only 2.5, or about one-fourth the weight of steel.
    Below we print a letter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span> from the Cowles Smelting and Aluminum Company
    on the subject.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="right mb0">“<span class="smcap">Lockport, N.Y., U.S.A.</span>, August 20, 1888.</p>

    <p>“<span class="smcap">R. P. Scott</span>, Esq., Baltimore Md.:</p>

    <p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,—Replying to your favor of August 16, you can
      obtain the book on Aluminum, by Richards, from Philadelphia.
      Aluminum has a great many uses in its commercial state, but a
      simple pure aluminum casting has not sufficient strength to make
      it desirable for small parts. If you could have it rolled or
      hammered to shape, so as to make it rigid, it would become much
      more tenacious, but to secure strength desired in bicycle parts,
      your castings would necessarily be so large as to be ungainly, and
      we doubt if you would attain the most desirable end,—viz., light
      weight. The alloys of copper and aluminum are much better adapted
      to your requirements than the pure metal could possibly be.</p>

    <p class="right"><span style="margin-right: 8em;">“Yours very truly,</span><br>
      “<span class="smcap" style="margin-right: 0.5em;">The Cowles E. S. and Al. Co.</span><br>
      “<cite>Tucker</cite>.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>It will be seen that the metal in its pure state lacks strength, and
    can only be used in the arts to any extent when alloyed with copper
    about in the proportion of nine of copper to one of aluminum. When
    alloyed as above, it is about as heavy as steel.</p>

    <p>The specific gravity of the A grade is 7.56, that of steel
      being 7.88. Its coefficient of expansion is small at ordinary
      temperatures; its electrical conductivity is about 9, and with the
      lower grades the expansion by heat, specific gravity and heat and
      electrical conductivity increases the nearer the metal approaches
      to pure copper. With more than eleven per cent. of aluminum the
      bronze rapidly becomes brittle. In color, aluminum bronze of the C
      and D grades is the nearest to gold of any known metal, the higher
      grades being lighter in hue than the lower. The A grade melts at
      about 1700° F., a little higher than ordinary bronze or brass.
      Aluminum bronze shrinks about twice as much as brass.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>In working aluminum I have found it to be a splendid substitute for
    malleable iron, especially in many cases where the iron could not be
    procured in time, or when it came so warped as to be unfit for use. I
    have never been able, however, to get castings which would come quite
    up to the strength claimed for it; the most satisfactory grade was
    that of ten-per-cent. aluminum, which by the way is very hard to work,
    especially in drilling. There is no doubt, however, that it can be made
    to take the place of steel in many instances.</p>

  <p>A knowledge of aluminum is a great boon to experimenters, as it
    will probably come into quite general use with the manufacturer. The
    ten-per-cent. aluminum finishes very handsomely, and in olden times
    it would have been a splendid substitute for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span> brass hubs then so
    common. As an antifriction metal it is unsurpassed by any of the
    bronzes. It casts bright and sharp, but shrinks amazingly, although
    not dangerously; at least I have never had a part of the casting drop
    off, as in malleable it often does, and though the aluminum sometimes
    leaves a great depression in the heavy part of the casting, it causes
    no sponginess underneath. It can be readily bronzed or soldered.</p>

  <p>Aluminum bronze drawn into wire will make very good spokes, and it has
    been used for this purpose to some extent in England. All tendency to
    rust is obviated, and it saves all nickeling; it resists corrosion
    sufficiently well to dispense with any covering, but it does not look
    as well as a nickel finish. No better authority on the subject can be
    had than that of the Cowles Catalogue; useful information also can
    be gathered from “Richards’s Aluminum,” and “Thurston’s Material of
    Engineering.” The last-named treatise speaks on the subject as follows:</p>

    <p>“The alloys of aluminum are very valuable. Its remarkable
      lightness, combined with its strength, makes it useful as a
      constituent of those alloys in which strength and lightness are the
      needed qualities. It has a pleasant metallic ring when struck, and
      confers a beautiful tone when introduced into bellmetal.</p>

    <p>“Aluminum may be added to bronzes and brasses with good results.
      The alloys (copper ninety per cent., aluminum ten per cent.) may be
      worked cold or hot like wrought iron, but not welded. Its tenacity
      is sometimes nearly one hundred thousand pounds per square inch.
      Its specific gravity is 7.7. In compression this alloy has been
      found capable of sustaining a little more than in tension,—one
      hundred and thirty thousand pounds per square inch (nine thousand
      one hundred and thirty nine kilos per square millimetre),—and its
      ductility and toughness were such that it did not even crack when
      distorted by this load. It is so ductile and malleable that it can
      be drawn down under the hammer to the fineness of a cambric needle.</p>

    <p>“It works well, casts well, holds a fine surface under the tool
      and when exposed to the weather, <em>and it is in every respect
      considered the best bronze yet known</em>. Its <em>high cost alone
      has prevented its extensive use in the arts</em>. These alloys are
      very uniform in character and work regularly and smoothly. Even
      one per cent. of aluminum added to copper causes a considerable
      increase<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span> in ductility and fusibility, and enables it to be used
      satisfactorily in making castings. Two per cent. gives a mixture
      used for castings which are to be worked with a chisel. It is
      softened by sudden cooling from a red heat. Its coefficient of
      expansion is small at ordinary temperatures.</p>

    <p>“It has great elasticity when made into springs; it has been found
      useful for watches, and has the decided advantage over steel of
      being little liable to oxidization. Kettles of aluminum bronze are
      used in making fruit syrups and preserves. Steel containing but
      .08 per cent. of aluminum is said to be greatly improved by its
      presence.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Aluminum bronze, such as would be required for cycle castings, costs
    from thirty to fifty cents per pound, according to quality and
    quantity. A valuable alloy of aluminum and iron has recently been made,
    by which it is maintained that wrought-iron castings are possible. The
    factory is, I believe, at Worcester, Mass. In our endeavor to learn
    more upon the subject we have been referred to the United States Mitis
    Co., No. 26 Broadway, New York, which company has the exclusive right
    in this country to make Mitis castings, or of granting permission to
    those who desire to make these castings themselves.</p>

  <h3>STRENGTH OF TUBES.</h3>

  <p>Metal in the form of tubes resists all strain liable to occur in cycle
    work better than in any other form. In regard to strain of compression,
    we find, in “Wood’s Resistance of Materials,” the following summary:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“Experiments heretofore made do not indicate a specific law of
      resistance to buckling, but the following general facts appear to
      be established: The resistance of buckling is always less than that
      of crushing, and is nearly independent of the length. Cylindrical
      tubes are strongest, and next in order are square tubes, and then
      the rectangular. Rectangular tubes <img src="images/i_184a.jpg" class="iglyph" alt="rectangle"> are not
      so strong as tubes of this form <img src="images/i_184b.jpg" class="iglyph" alt="divided rectangle">.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>There is, however, very little direct crushing strain on the tubes in
    a cycle; it is almost entirely a strain of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span> flexure or bending; hence
    this is the only interesting feature pertaining to the subject in
    cycling work.</p>

  <p>Since a tube is stronger than a solid bar, for same weight the
    intuitive idea is to make the tube as large as possible, and the
    mathematical demonstration which we append shows this to be correct,
    generally speaking.</p>

  <p>Let <i>R</i> equal the strain per square inch of cross-section of the
    tube at the point farthest removed from the neutral axis at the instant
    of rupture.</p>

  <figure class="figcenter illowp90" id="i_185">
    <img src="images/i_185.jpg" alt="">
    <figcaption>Tube sections.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>Suppose Fig. 1 to represent the half of the tube, and that you
    are trying to bend it down at the ends. The particles towards the
    top will be pulled apart, while those at the bottom are crowded
    together; somewhere between the top and bottom the particles
    are neither pulled apart nor crowded together. Were the tube
    solid, the line of these particles would be the neutral axis.
    In the tube an imaginary line through the centre of the hole
    does not vary much from said axis. Now the moment of rupture =
    <span class="frac"><sup><i>R</i>π</sup><sub>4<i>r</i><sub>e</sub></sub></span>(<i>r</i><sup>4</sup><sub>e</sub>&nbsp;−&nbsp;<i>r</i><sup>4</sup><sub>i</sub>), where
    <i>r</i><sub>e</sub> and <i>r</i><sub>i</sub> (<a href="#i_185">Fig. 2</a>) are the exterior and interior
    radii; <span class="frac"><sup><i>R</i>π</sup><sub>4</sub></span> is a constant, which we will call <i>K</i>,
    whence we can write moment of rupture
    = <i>K</i>(<i>r</i><sub>e</sub><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;−&nbsp;<i>r</i><sub>i</sub><sup>2</sup>)&nbsp;(<i>r</i><sub>e</sub><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<i>r</i><sub>i</sub><sup>2</sup>) ÷ <i>r</i><sub>e</sub>.
    Here the factor (<i>r</i><sub>e</sub><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;−&nbsp;<i>r</i><sub>i</sub><sup>2</sup>) is proportional
    to the area of the annular cross-section and is constant, while
    the other factor, (<i>r</i><sub>e</sub><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<i>r</i><sub>i</sub><sup>2</sup>)&nbsp;÷&nbsp;<i>r</i><sub>e</sub>
    or, <i>r</i><sub>e</sub>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<span class="frac"><sup><i>r</i><sub>i</sub></sup><sub><i>r</i><sub>e</sub></sub></span>&nbsp;<i>r</i><sub>i</sub>, though
    less than 2<i>r</i><sub>e</sub>, gets nearer and nearer to 2<i>r</i><sub>e</sub> as
    <i>r</i><sub>e</sub> gets large and <i>r</i><sub>i</sub> approaches <i>r</i><sub>e</sub>.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span></p>

  <p>Therefore we have, that in resistance to flexure the tube should be as
    large in diameter as practicable, which means that it must be as thin
    as possible. This result is only modified in practice by the necessity
    of guarding against dinging and also against imperfections in the
    steel. A surface crack will ruin a very thin tube which otherwise may
    be harmless in a thicker, but it is safe to say that it is best to use
    reasonably large thin tubes.</p>

  <p>Oval tubes are of an advantage only when the direction of the strain
    is positively known and when it invariably occurs in that direction.
    Since the tube finds its greatest limit of general resistance in
    cylindrical form, to alter that form must necessarily weaken it more in
    one direction than it strengthens it in another.</p>

  <div class="subheadc">THE CYCLE IN WAR—STEAM AND ELECTRICITY.</div>

  <p>No more important and interesting phase in the development of the
    wheel has recently occurred than the consideration and partial adoption
    of the cycle in military affairs. Already this subject has engaged the
    attention of English and continental war departments. At first the
    tricycle was adjudged the most promising form of man-motor carriage for
    the army, but latterly authorities have directed their attention to the
    more sensible and practical plan of adopting the Rover-type Safety.
    Some advantages could be named favoring the tricycle, but certainly,
    with the slight effort needful to master the rear-driver, if the cycle
    ever attains any prominent place in the military field, it will be in
    the form of a single-track machine. In all countries where reasonable
    roads can be expected the cycle must succeed in this warlike department
    of usefulness; not that we ever expect to hear of the charge of the
    cycle corps, or of a hand-to-hand sword combat upon the “festive
    bikes,” though such things are within the pale of possibility; what we
    do expect to hear of in the next war is the cycle scout and forager and
    of the cycle corps getting there ahead of the cavalry. With a light
    bicycle that can be lifted over small obstructions, an expert could go
    almost anywhere that it would be practicable to take a horse, and when
    you consider how much easier it would be to conceal your cycle, in case
    a little excursion on foot were necessary, and how much less danger
    there would be when no provender or shelter is required for the steed,
    certainly the idea is feasible. It has been said that a horse can go
    where a cycle cannot;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span> while this is sometimes true, on the other hand,
    there are places where the cycle can be taken when the horse would
    have to be left behind. For instance, a steep rocky cliff might be
    surmounted by the man and his bicycle, since the latter could be easily
    drawn over after him; in fact, he could go with his machine over almost
    any place which it would be possible to clamber himself, while by no
    means would this apply to the horse; in short, we feel assured that
    war cycling promises great development in the armies of all civilized
    nations, and to this end the most solid, powerful, unbreakable, and at
    the same time light, wheel must be striven for by any maker who would
    advance the art in this direction, and reap the consequent substantial
    returns to his exchequer.</p>

  <h3>STEAM, ELECTRICITY, SPRINGS, AND COMPRESSED AIR AS MOTORS.</h3>

  <p>This heading is not entirely germane to the subject of man-motor
    locomotion, but we will take advantage of the fact that in all
    mechanical motors that will ever be applied to bicycles and tricycles
    there will have to be an auxiliary apparatus for the feet. This is
    obvious, since in any break-down the rider will need some means of
    getting home. As the ocean steamers retain some apologies for sails,
    so the cycler will have to retain his foot-power mechanism in any
    machine he might adopt for individual transportation, though the
    main motor power be steam or electricity, one of which may finally
    be adopted in cycles. That every rider will care for this extraneous
    assistance is doubtful, as the element of exercise would be eliminated
    to a great extent. For practical uses aside from exercise, as in the
    transaction of business, etc., other motors than that of human energy
    would be a boon in the present cycle, but they would never be used to
    the exclusion of the legs. Already many experiments have been made,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
    some quite successful, both in steam and electricity, but the steam I
    think affords the greater prospect of success, because the necessary
    conditions are naturally more nearly complete. Whatever motor is used,
    it will be necessary to have supply-stations at intervals along the
    road, which would require but little effort to establish for steam,
    since oil and water can be obtained almost anywhere now, and positive
    arrangements could easily be made to have the necessary supplies kept
    at all the cross-roads stores. All that is required is that some one
    shall put a practical steam bicycle upon the market, with all parts as
    light as possible and with oil for fuel. The main principles have all
    been worked out separately, and what we need now is a combination of
    the most improved methods and a go-ahead man to push the business.</p>

  <p>Electricity is as yet too indefinite in its development, in this
    direction, to encourage the hope that it can, at present, be made
    available. The only prospective means of utilizing it as a road-motor
    is by the use of secondary or storage batteries, which would require
    dynamos scattered along the road for recharging them; but the
    slightest thought will show that this expensive arrangement is hardly
    a possibility considering the enormous distances and length of roads,
    especially in this country.</p>

  <p>We have only to mention compressed air and springs, in order to
    dispose of them; the former does not promise much, and as to the
    latter, all efforts in that direction which have come under the
    writer’s notice have been quite nonsensical.</p>

  <div class="subheadc">CYCLE PATENTS AND INVENTORS.</div>

  <p>The ever ubiquitous Yankee inventor fell upon an inexhaustible mine
    when he tapped the virgin soil of cycledom, and his English brother
    has not been much less fortunate; in fact, it is questionable whether
    Jonathan has been able to keep the start of Brother Bull in this
    matter, with three thousand patents on record in the American office
    against three thousand five hundred provisional in the English,
    thirteen hundred and twenty of the latter being sealed, up to March,
    1889. Few fields of invention have ever developed so rapidly and
    interested so many inventors with as little apparent advance to the
    casual observer. As I have stated in a former chapter, the advance has
    been a sort of evolution, creditable to those who work the changes, yet
    with little chance at any time for what is termed a broad patent. When
    the saddle was raised up over the cranks and the front wheel enlarged,
    a great stride forward in the art was made, yet it is questionable
    whether such changes afforded sufficient ground for strong patent
    claims; twenty years ago they certainly would not have done so, with
    the feeling and usual action of the patent authorities and general
    stupidity of patent attorneys at that time. Mere changes in the sizes
    of wheels would stand a much better chance of being patentable now
    than some time ago. We have, in fact, a patent now existing, given out
    to an Englishman, on the Safety rear-driving pattern of machine, in
    which the proportional diameter of the wheels is pretty well claimed.
    How this patent was wedged into the American office is somewhat
    remarkable; if it could be held valid,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span> makers of rear-drivers with a
    front wheel as large or larger than the rear would find it warm work to
    continue. Fitting cranks upon the drive-wheel would, with modern patent
    attorneys, have afforded a broad field for good claims, but it did not
    seem to in Lallement’s time, seeing the kind he got. The rubber tire,
    in spite of the fact that it was perhaps the greatest element of all
    in making a cycle a practical roadster, was so old in other relations
    that the U. S. patent of Serrel, No. 87,713, afforded no protection
    to the inventor; but even if it had been used on the wheels of some
    machines within the knowledge of the Patent Office, which could be
    used as a reference, a good attorney would now hardly abandon a claim
    for its use in a cycle on that account. The claim to the hollow or
    tubular construction of frame,<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> though ingenious, was laughed at by
    good patent experts; it was the one thing that was old and by right
    absolutely unpatentable. Yet the attempt to hold it had at one time
    better prospects of being successful than any other in connection with
    the great principles in modern cycles; unless the mud-guard should
    be considered a great principle. The ball-bearings were broadly old,
    as shown in the American office; still, very good patents have been
    obtained upon them, sufficient to cause several famous law-suits. There
    was some good ground for these patents, but I doubt if any better than
    was found in the case of the rubber tire, the large drive-wheel, or,
    particularly, the step for mounting the ordinary bicycle, and possibly
    no better than was found in the tubular construction.</p>

  <p>The American Patent Office and the courts more recently take the view
    that if a man has really done something in the art they will give him a
    patent. This is absolutely necessary under existing circumstances, as
    it is almost impossible, with the enormous number of patents that have
    been issued, to invent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span> anything upon which the Office cannot find some
    sort of reference, and for this reason it is proper that the evidence
    of invention should rest largely on the fact of general success and
    value in the market. The courts are liable to ask, “Why, if a certain
    invention is so old and obvious and in such great demand, was it not
    used before?”</p>

  <p>The Patent Offices, both in America and in England, have become so
    utterly clogged with cycle patents that it takes great ingenuity to
    get in anything that is broadly new. The patents are necessarily on
    some detail of construction, except perhaps in the open field afforded
    by the innovation of the rear-driver, just as there has been some
    attempt to improve upon the “Rothigiesser system,” in which a German
    inventor claims to ride “hands-off”, as spoken of elsewhere. There
    is also a good opening in tandem bicycles and tricycles, and in the
    anti-vibration element of the rear-driver, but the field is rapidly
    closing in.</p>

  <h3>THE CYCLE INVENTOR.</h3>

  <p>Close upon the question of patents comes the idea of the cycle
    inventor. It is not my desire to in any way curtail the income of
    the respective governments of the world, or to embarrass the Patent
    Offices thereof, by causing a lack of new applications, but the cycle
    inventor, as well as inventors in other departments, might profit by
    a little advice from a personal stand-point. A glance at the numerous
    samples of patents illustrated in this book, and a thought of the total
    number issued, should be enough to convince any fair-minded reader
    that many useless fees are yearly dropped into the patent-slot at both
    the American and English offices. This fact, together with an extended
    experience in other departments of invention and a limited turn at the
    gridiron upon which the cycle inventor is grilled, has caused a few
    facts appertaining to inventors and patents to dawn upon me, which
    I now propose to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span> inflict upon the reader. These things are not the
    discovery of a sore-head; they are related by one who has to thank
    the patent department of his country for all of his worldly financial
    success.</p>

  <p>If you think of a good thing in cycles, don’t rush off to the Patent
    Office all at once; just stop a little, there is no hurry, and do
    this. Draw off a good sketch of the thing, put a date upon it at once,
    and explain it to one or two trustworthy friends and have them sign
    the sketch as witnesses. Get this done, and then breathe a little
    while. Next, write out this question in large bold letters,—Do I want
    to go into the cycle business? After cool deliberation, taking into
    account your capacity, your wealth, your family, present occupation,
    and prospects, if you can answer in the affirmative, then you may be
    bolder. If your answer is nay, then go very cautiously. In any case,
    be sure you do this next. Send the sketch and about ten dollars to a
    first-class patent-attorney, with instructions to make a five-dollar
    preliminary examination and to spend the other five dollars in copies
    of patents nearest allied to your invention, and insist that the
    attorney sends these copies to you. Either in the English or American
    office you should be able to get them at twenty-five cents each, and
    for less if you order a quantity. If you have any knowledge of the
    art, you ought to be as good a judge as the attorney whether these
    patents anticipate your own or not; but whatever you do, don’t take
    out a patent simply because one can be had. Study calmly and lucidly
    whether your thing is of any account or not, and practically try it, if
    possible. If you conclude to take out a patent, be sure and employ a
    good attorney, being particularly wary of the low-priced men. Not that
    I would say to always employ the old attorneys of great reputation,
    because a young practitioner, if unusually bright, will perhaps make up
    in extra time spent upon the case what he lacks in astuteness of snap
    judgment.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span></p>

  <p>Beware of the “no patent, no pay” fellows. It costs just as much to
    find out that the office will not grant the patent as to find out that
    it will, unless a careful preliminary settles the case definitely. You
    can be assured that if the invention is promising it will ultimately,
    in all probability, have to stand the scrutiny of a court before
    it will be of any great value. If you do not intend to go into the
    manufacture of your invention, a good plan is to offer it to a reliable
    man already in the business before you go into any expense at all;
    of course, taking the precaution of having your sketch witnessed, as
    before advised. Very few manufacturers in the cycle or any other line
    are the notorious patent thieves they are commonly supposed to be;
    especially are they loath to take advantage of a confiding inventor who
    has no patent. Of course, if you have taken out a patent, and pretend
    by virtue thereof to assert that you are protected, you make yourself
    a legitimate prey if your patent happens to be invalid, which it often
    is even when the invention deserves the most rigid protection. There
    are, in all, over five thousand patents in the world in connection with
    the cycle art, many of which are sound. Think of this before you divert
    your mind from your legitimate business. It seems hard to the general
    would-be inventor to say it, but I believe that the proper persons to
    spend their time and talents in the invention of cycles are the persons
    employed by the manufacturers for that purpose. In trusting to the
    judgment of the manufacturer in regard to any idea you may have, if you
    keep your sketch and a copy of your correspondence, it will be powerful
    evidence against him if he plays false with you and goes into a fight
    for priority of invention. Almost any manufacturer will answer a letter
    about a new idea in his own line, and if he decides against you he
    will generally give his reasons, from which you can judge whether it
    will pay you to go ahead or not. This advice may seem to encourage a
    great risk to the inventor, but I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span> give it from the experience on both
    sides of the fence. Inventors will say that they get no attention
    from manufacturers; this, when true, is almost invariably because the
    alleged invention is absolutely unworthy of any attention at all,
    though of course all inquiries should receive courteous answers.</p>

  <p>The real inventor is a very nice fellow, but the chronic inventor is
    generally a bore. Take notice, my dear reader, of one fact, how few
    of the great inventions were the work of chronic inventors. I do not
    refer to men who have simply taken out a number of patents in their own
    particular line: one of the best cures for chronic inventorism is to
    resolve to confine yourself to one line; the next best cure being to
    firmly conclude never to take out a second patent until the first has
    paid you something, or has done you some good in some way. The great
    inventors are those who stick to one thing until success is attained or
    absolute failure fully demonstrated. Why, now, this anathema against
    the chronic inventor? It is this: the chronic inventor is lazy; you say
    he will stay up at night, work all day, and never sleep; well, let him,
    all except the work; this element is supposititious. It is <em>not</em>
    work, and here is just where the trouble comes in,—the chronic inventor
    stops just where the work begins. It is fun to invent, and it only
    takes a little practice to be able to accomplish it; it is as easy as
    “castle-building,” but when you come to build the real castle, out of
    good hard stone and grimy mortar,—“ay, there’s the rub!”</p>

  <p>The men who have really done something to the benefit of the world,
    are those who have reduced their inventions (or those of some one else)
    to practice and brought them before the people. A great invention
    which has never gotten beyond the confines of the brain that evolved
    it might as well never have been evolved at all. Nor is it any better
    that a pasteboard model lies moulding in the garret; and, strange as
    it may appear, a record of the same in the Patent Office does not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span> help
    matters much. See the number of patents, many of which are good, lying
    in the files at the Patent Office,—neglected and forgotten by everybody
    except the examiner, who persistently uses them as ammunition against
    the real benefactor of mankind who, though subsequent, would like to do
    something with them.</p>

  <p>Before my early entrance into the arena of invention, I had a suspicion
    that some of the work of benefiting mankind, if so high a title be
    justifiable, consisted in getting an invention into practical and
    useful form for general use. I also had some premonition that it
    would require a portion of the ingenuity to get the pay for it at the
    hands of the populace. In this connection a diverting amusement was
    discovered in the way of apportioning the ingenuity to the different
    departments of the required work. My original scale was as follows:
    One-half of the ingenuity to inventing the thing, one-fourth to getting
    up the tools and making same, and one-fourth to placing upon the market
    and gathering in the returns.</p>

  <p>After a little experience the schedule was remodelled, making one-third
    to each section. Later on, the entire schedule underwent a most decided
    and radical change. It stands now as follows:</p>

  <p><em>Scale of proportional genius required for each department in
    benefiting mankind (and yourself) by means of invention</em>: Two
    per cent., inventing; seven per cent., getting into shape; three
    per cent., getting American patent; one-hundredth of one per cent.,
    getting English patent; ten per cent., getting patent through
    court; twenty-eight per cent., getting the money; forty-nine and
    ninety-nine-hundredths per cent., keeping it after you get it.</p>

  <p>The cycle hobbyist is one of the quaint characters of the fraternity,
    and he exists in profusion; turns up at all the meets, and always makes
    his ubiquitous presence felt.</p>

  <p>Only make a wheel big enough, a lever long enough, or a spring strong
    enough, and he has you foul.</p>

  <p>Some of them have pet schemes of storing compressed air in the tubes;
    others, more practical, make vague hints at a mile a minute with their
    electrical or steam motors; while others of these embryo inventors
    would outdo the now notorious Keely with their wonders; and the only
    surprise is that they would stop to fix the thing to a cycle, when a
    most diverting amusement could be found in starting the earth around
    backward or in drawing the poles straight up and thereby making an
    eternal spring.</p>

  <p>Such fundamental principles as that a short lever hung in the middle is
    just as powerful as a long one hung in the same way; that two turns of
    a small wheel rolls over as much ground as one turn of another twice
    the size; that there is no more power in a spring than you put into it,
    and many other like principles, all seem to be forgotten in the general
    rush to be the first to make a mile a minute on a dirt road.</p>

  <p>Truly we inhabit a wonderful sphere; only just make gravity pull
    sideways, and we would have no further use for locomotives. Somehow or
    other, however, the contrary old gravity continues to haul everything
    just its own way, and that is just the way we do not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span> care to go, either
    now or in the distant future. Certainly all would-be perpetual-motion
    makers must feel that something satanic is working against them in this
    unceasing pull of gravity in the wrong direction.</p>

  <p>But to revert to our cycle hobbyist in particular. A friend of the
    writer’s, a prominent man, intelligent in all other things, once
    proposed to pull all the Chicago street-cars by having a man in each,
    continually winding a spring, said spring to drive the car; and he knit
    his brow in half offence at the suggestion that there would be less
    danger of the wheels slipping if the spring-worker would get out and
    pull by the front platform.</p>

  <p>No one can readily believe how common such ideas as the above spring
    method are till they scour the patent-office records, or talk to the
    cycle hobbyist. Intelligent men often remark “how powerful” a certain
    machine must be “with that long lever,” when the lever is hung to be
    worked from the short end; and how often we have heard them condemn the
    thirty-inch safeties as being slow, on account of the small wheel. Even
    to cycle-riders not aspiring to the high degree of hobbyists it was
    a matter of surprise, when the old Kangaroo came out, that it pushed
    harder when geared to the sixty than others geared to fifty.</p>

  <p>“Big wheel, big speed,” seems to be indelibly written in the mind
    of the cycle hobbyist; but we will forgive him all such little
    inconsistencies if he will only let us continue to believe that there
    is no innate power in a gear wheel.</p>

  <p>I once knew a successful manufacturer who geared up a sausage-cutter to
    double speed, and then down again to the same, and he believes to this
    day that it runs easier on account of these four gear wheels. I have
    often thought that the cycling fraternity would not have cared much
    whether it did or not, if he had only made it large enough to take in a
    few cycle hobbyists.</p>

  <p>“Pull a bicycle from the rim,” and you have power<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span> only equalled by
    the pinch-bar. Did anybody notice the half-page advertisement of a
    prominent English maker a few years ago, of the tricycle that pulled
    from the rim (probably not endorsed by the said maker, it being merely
    contract work for an outsider)? and have any of our American readers
    ever seen the old bone-shaker wheel with the cross-bar on the hub?
    (See cut.) For years they were used in England with the benighted
    idea, in the minds of many, that they thereby gained in power. One of
    these wheels of eight-day size is suspended in front of a building in
    Coventry (or was a few years ago), used as a sign. This wheel “pulls
    by the rim,” at least so I was quite often informed, not always by
    reputable English makers, but by riders, who mostly see these great
    principles (?) first.</p>

  <figure class="figcenter illowp58" id="i_199">
    <img src="images/i_199.jpg" alt="">
    <figcaption>Old bone-shaker wheel.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>The error appertaining to all such ideas is generally the result
    of confusing external with internal forces. We must have the hub of
    a wheel connected to the rim in some substantial manner, so that
    both will revolve rigidly together; further than this the manner of
    connecting them can matter but little so far as transmission of power
    is concerned. All that is necessary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span> is that the hub shall not revolve
    within the rim independently and thereby cause a lack of firmness.</p>

  <p>Another sample of the hobbyistic idea is promulgated in the following
    from <cite>The Cyclist</cite> in a recent issue.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="center">“A NEW BRAKE.</p>

    <p>“Mr. ——, of ——, has patented a good idea. On the other side of
      the forks from the regulation plunger he introduces another spoon
      connected with the front under the arch of the fork, provision
      being made for the mud-guard. On moving the lever, both brakes act
      in unison, thus duplicating the resistance with the same power
      required to work the brake in its single form.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>If it takes a certain pressure to hold the first brake down, and none
    to hold the second, why not put on two seconds and no first, and thus
    have a good brake power without any pressure at all?</p>

  <p>Since penning the above I have heard further of the new brake in
    question, and have been tempted to cancel the paragraph, since
    injustice might be done to an honest inventor; but on second thought
    concluded to retain it as an example of careless statement, knowing
    that others were misled by the same. Had the inventor simply remarked
    that he had made use of his momentum, transmitted through the rim of
    the wheel, and acting to wedge one of the brakes against the head
    or the other brake, whereby to increase the brake, or some such
    explanation, everybody would have acquiesced in it as a reasonable
    possibility, even if they had not the slightest idea of what the
    inventor was talking about. It is a satisfaction to know that it is
    becoming a little dangerous, in the cycle art, to make a statement that
    savors of getting something for nothing.</p>

  <p>A prominent American maker, whose wares now stand high in our market,
    must have been a hobbyist once too, when he climbed the steps into
    an English bicycle factory on his lever tricycle. Probably he has
    reformed, as I hear of no step-climbing now.</p>

  <p>Only within a few days I have had an offer to inspect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span> a machine that
    the inventor assumes will make a mile a minute. “No other machine was
    ever made to work by hand and foot,” says the same inventor. He also
    assures me that wire wheels are a mistake, and that the old wooden ones
    are just as good and cheaper. This machine has an ingenious device by
    which to lock the front wheel of a bicycle, to save the trouble of
    holding the handle-bars “when you don’t want to steer.” This much I
    believe the inventor may be right about. A machine, properly made, run
    by hand and foot, might make short distances very rapidly, since the
    entire energy of the man could be quickly used up; but whether such a
    machine would be of marketable value is a question.</p>

  <p>Quite recently a new “hickory wheel” man of more formidable caliber has
    entered the lists, and again we are called back to bone-shaker days.
    Well! after the beetle (rear-driver) has been so fondly embraced, let
    us be prepared for anything that may come. We have dropped down from
    the cat to the kitten, and can now get out through a pretty small hole
    if hard pressed; so for the present we will hold the hickory wheel on
    probation.</p>

  <p>A gentleman at Coventry, a few years ago, conceived, and spent a small
    fortune upon, a plan for overcoming the dead centre in crank tricycles;
    his method was quite simple: he only had to turn an angle on the crank
    at the outer extremity like a letter L, so that when the straight or
    radial part, represented by the stem of the L with the axle through the
    upper end, stood vertical, the pedal, which is supposed to be attached
    to the tip of the horizontal extension, would have passed some two
    inches beyond the dead-centre point.</p>

  <p>This same inventor had an enormous steel spring ensconced beneath the
    seat of his machine, which he wound with his hands as he went along.
    Whenever the proprietor of the establishment where these experiments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
    were being conducted ran short of work he invariably proposed to the
    inventor to “go out and try the tricycle.”</p>

  <p>The writer was a moderate hobbyist himself once, and has perhaps not
    yet entirely recovered from the spell. Below find a letter written some
    time ago, while the delusion was still upon him.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="center">“AN AMERICAN HOBBYIST.</p>

    <p class="smcap hang">“Trials and Tribulations of an American
      Abroad—How Pet Theories are received in the Bicycling Centre of the World.</p>

    <p class="smcap noindent">“Editor Springfield Wheelmen’s Gazette:</p>

    <p>“Some friend has kindly sent me a copy of the <cite>Gazette</cite>, and I
      make haste to remit you the amount of subscription.</p>

    <p>“I will not assume that the bicycling papers of the country of
      which I am now a guest are not good. In fact, to do so would libel
      my host; I simply say that, being an American, I like American
      papers.</p>

    <p>“In the letter I first wrote, of which this is in main a copy, I
      asserted that the papers here were too much taken up by race-course
      news, but even since then I have received a copy of an English
      periodical which I find is not open to the objection given; hence I
      will still speak cautiously, lest I do not know all yet.</p>

    <p>“I have no penchant for the race-course; in fact, I never ran but
      one race, and then I was left so far behind that I have never
      been interested in racing news since. In one respect my race was
      a success, for I was loudly cheered by the crowd opposite the
      starting-point, for by some fortunate error they got the idea that
      I had been handicapped half a lap, that being about my distance
      in the rear at the end of the first round. Since that time I have
      confined myself exclusively to touring, with which object my
      brother and I came to England this spring.</p>

    <p>“I have been admitted to membership in the Cyclists’ Touring Club,
      and must say it is a grand institution, and the official organ
      thereof is a valuable journal.</p>

    <p>“If you and your readers will permit me to speak of my object
      in making a centre at Coventry without denouncing it as merely a
      scheme whereby to benefit in a free advertisement, I would say that
      I have taken the liberty—almost a criminal one it seems here—of
      having a <em>hobby</em> relating to an ‘ideal bicycle.’ This is from
      a <em>tourist’s</em> stand-point; not that of a racer, or it would
      have been all right.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span></p>

    <p>“My hobby consists in the following hobbies in detail: 1. A bicycle
      with a large front wheel, because it rides smoother and steers
      easier than any other. 2. A bicycle in which you are directly over
      the work and do not have to reach out to do it, or lean over the
      handle-bar to get your centre of gravity over it. I should think
      the ‘Grasshopper’ good in this respect. 3. A bicycle in which
      the legs are <em>at rest</em> on all down grade, or when work is
      unnecessary, <em>à la Star</em>. 4. A bicycle with a treadle motion,
      as I think power is more economically applied by the same. (This
      is largely theory, so far.) 5. A bicycle with no dead centre at
      any time, as I think it is a continual impediment in up-hill or
      rough roads (also theory). 6. A bicycle where one foot going down
      lifts the other positively, as in a crank; to lift by springs I
      consider bad. 7. A bicycle safer from headers than the common
      large wheel machines, say about comparable with the ‘Grasshopper.’
      I do not aspire to the security of the small wheelers, nor do
      I like the other known safety devices (probably prejudice). 8.
      (Ordinary bicyclers’ pride suggests No. 8.) A bicycle as neat and
      trim in appearance as the common large wheel crank-machine without
      octopus-clawed walking beams, gear wheels, or chains swinging
      through the air in full view at long range. 9. A bicycle that
      brakes from the hind wheel, as there is less danger of headers. 10.
      A bicycle with some good sort of safety handle-bar that will be
      open to no objections found in those now used. This is to prevent
      injury in case of a header, and also to store the bicycle in less
      space.</p>

    <p>“You will infer, of course, that I had a plan for combining these
      hobbies; hence my trip to Coventry with a view to having such a
      machine made for my own use. When I arrived here and called on some
      of the bicycle manufacturers and made my purpose known, I cannot
      say that I was quite so well received as your correspondent C.; in
      fact, a Yankee inventor does not seem to be such desirable property
      in Coventry as a foreign agent, and yet I doubt not that a real
      genius of the former sort might do them much more good. Now, I
      think I was entitled to the reception of such a character for at
      least the few minutes it would have taken to expose the error, but
      there seems to be a sort of suspicious dread of a Yankee inventor,
      which is all wrong and against their interest. The greatest fault I
      have to find is in the manner in which they insist that I could not
      possibly know anything about the bicycle business, or have a right
      to a hobby and waste some money on it if I wanted to.</p>

    <p>“The bad weather has detained us here much longer than we thought
      to stay, but we do not regret it, as it is the best centre in
      England from which to make short tours. The attractions of this
      ancient city are innumerable, and the proximity of Kenilworth,
      Warwick, and Stratford-on-Avon need only be mentioned to make
      Coventry all I assert.</p>

    <p>“You will pardon me if I say that my new machine is all and more
      than I expected; but a word to all hobbyists before I close:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span> Have
      you a hobby? If so, then ‘bend low and with bated breath I will a
      secret tale unfold.’</p>

    <p>“<em>Have your hobby</em>, nourish it, talk and write about it, and
      make everybody believe you can fly; don’t let anybody down you, get
      in the last kick at every man who won’t think just as you do, but
      just as you are going to put it in practice, stop! slip quietly to
      your escritoire, get out your book, go straight to the bank, and
      have it accurately footed up; if there is a fat balance, and you
      are unmarried, with no other care on your mind, and nothing to do
      for seven years, then go in, and God speed to you.</p>

    <p>“If the above conditions fail you, go straight home, kiss your
      wife, and baby if you have any, and thank Providence that you are
      saved from the lunatic asylum and your family from poverty and want.</p>

  <h3 class="mt5">REMARKS ON BOLTON U. S. PATENT, SEPTEMBER 29, 1804.</h3>

  <p class="center">(<i><a href="#i_036">See cut</a>, page 36</i>.)</p>

  <p>This early inventor, who had the honor of President Jefferson’s
    signature to his patent, was a clever genius in his time. I am
    constrained to think he was of that school which believes in the
    inherent power of the gear wheel; at least the four wheels, where there
    is no demand for more than two, would suggest this idea. According to
    our present system of gauging, this machine is geared to about fifteen.
    Mr. Bolton, however, was a pioneer, and as such we must hold him in
    great veneration.</p>

  <h3>ENGLISH PATENT, DECEMBER 2, 1818.</h3>

  <p class="center">(<i><a href="#i_035">See cut</a>, page 35.</i>)</p>

  <p>There has been considerable discussion anent the earliest bicycle
    inventor, but after all his name seems to have been “Dennis,” or rather
    Dennis Johnson. As “Dennis” has been before us in the periodicals for a
    number of years, we will not dwell upon him; suffice it to say that his
    name will always hold the high place it deserves, as the first patentee
    of a single-track balancing machine.</p>

  <h3>CROFT AMERICAN PATENT.</h3>

  <p>The inventor, Mr. Croft, a cut of whose machine will be found on <a href="#i_038">page 38</a>,
    was one, and probably the earliest, of those who have deceived
    themselves with the idea that power could be increased by means of a
    solid grip on the ground, forgetting a common principle that, so long
    as the hold does not give way, one plan is as good as another in this
    respect. Below find a brief of his specification.</p>

  <p>“The object of this invention is to furnish an improved tricycle,
    designed for use by mechanics and others for going to and from their
    places of business, by merchants and others for sending small parcels
    from one place to another, and by youths and others for amusement and
    exercise, and which shall be simple in construction and easily operated.</p>

  <p>“To the stirrups J are pivoted the rear ends of two rods K, the forward
    ends of which are pivoted to the forward axle B, near its ends, so that
    the rider can guide and turn the machine with his feet.</p>

  <p>“The rider propels the machine by means of two rods, L, which he holds
    in his hands, and which he presses against the ground. In starting,
    the rider presses both rods L against the ground at the same time, but
    after he has got up enough motion to give momentum to the machine, he

  <p>The cut on opposite page is a part of the Bramley &amp; Parker English
    patent of 1830. These early inventors were apparently the original
    tandem makers, and they possibly originated the expression “lay down to
    the work.” If the cuts fairly represent the inventors, truly no one can
    deny that they were handsome fellows, and that they deserve a greater
    reward than can be said to have accrued to them after the shades of
    fifty years have fallen upon this, probably the greatest effort of
    their lives. Below find another part of their specification, which
    illustrates the verbosity of legal language found in those, and to some
    extent in the present English patents.</p>

  <p>“... In which said Letters Patent is contained a proviso that we,
    the said Thomas Bramley or Robert Parker, or one of us, shall cause
    a particular description of the nature of my said Invention, and in
    what manner the same is to be performed, to be inrolled in His said
    Majesty’s High Court of Chancery within six calendar months next and
    immediately after the date of the said in part recited Letters Patent,
    as in and by the same, reference being thereunto had, will more fully
    and at large appear.”</p>

  <h3>FRENCH PATENT.</h3>

  <h4>M. JULIEN. JUNE 30, 1830.</h4>

  <p>The French patent to M. Julien, date of June 30, 1830, of whose machine
    a cut will be found on the opposite page, seems to be for a sort of
    combination of cycle and plough. It is to be inferred that M. Julien
    proposes to do up his ploughing, and then mount his cycle and off to
    town for an airing.</p>

  <p>Jeering and contemptuous cyclers will be liable to overlook a novel and
    invaluable feature of this invention relating to security in descending
    long and dangerous hills. The rider can, by easy manipulation of
    certain simple and ingenious devices, lower the plough and thereby
    bring into operation a brake of great power and unquestionable
    holding-back proclivities. As to the steering, it does not appear,
    from the drawing, how this may be accomplished, but so fertile a brain
    cannot have left this necessary adjunct unprovided for.</p>

  <p>That the machine can be worked with little exertion is implied by
    the skilful introduction, on the part of the draughtsman, of the
    chimney-pot hat which adorns the brow of the supposed agricultural
    gentleman upon the box, and also by the general appearance of ease and
    comfort which pervades the entire picture.</p>

  <h4>“THE ORIGINAL BICYCLE.</h4>

  <p>“At the late Stanley Show was exhibited the machine which is now
    generally conceded to be the original bicycle. We present a cut of
    the machine reproduced from the <cite>Scottish Cyclist</cite>, also a
    representation of the features of the inventor, one Gavin Dalzell, a
    merchant of Lesmahgon, Lanarkshire, Scotland. Dalzell was born August
    29, 1811, and died June 14, 1863. He possessed decided talent for
    mechanical inventions. From the written testimony of a letter, and
    the testimony of J. B. Dalzell, son of the inventor and present owner
    of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span> machine, it is proved that it was in use previous to 1846, and
    there are eye-witnesses who recollect the inventor riding his bicycle
    over the roads of Lanarkshire.</p>

  <p>“In construction the Dalzell bicycle is the exact prototype of the now
    popular rear-driving safety.</p>

  <p>“It is constructed chiefly of wood, which, though worm-eaten, is
    still wonderfully strong, especially in the wheels, these seeming to
    have stood the ravages of time and rough usage much better than the
    frame-work. The rear wheel—the driver—is of wood, shod with iron, about
    forty inches in diameter, and has twelve spokes, each about an inch in
    diameter. The front wheel is of similar construction, but only of about
    thirty inches in diameter. From the front wheel hub the fork—straight,
    and with a rake which some of our modern makers could copy with
    profit—passes up, and is joined together, through the fore-part of
    the wooden frame-work. A pair of handles are then attached and bent
    backward into a <span class="sans">V</span> shape to suit the rider, who sits
    about two feet behind the front-wheel hub. These were commonly termed
    the ‘reins.’ The main frame is somewhat like that which is now termed
    the ‘dip’ pattern, the design of which is applied in an extended form
    to ladies’ safeties.</p>

  <p>“A wooden mud-guard rises from this frame, covering about one-fourth
    of the circumference of the hind wheel; from this to the back forks,
    which are horizontal, and of wood, vertical flat stays run down,
    forming a dress-guard after the manner of those on the latest cycling
    development,—the ladies’ safety. The action thus obtained is not
    rotary, being a downward and forward thrust with return, the feet
    describing a small segment of a circle. That the gearing, which
    constitutes the chief wonder to the critical and historical reader, was
    actually on the machine while being ridden by Mr. Dalzell, is proved by
    the receipted accounts of the blacksmith, John Leslie, who made all the
    iron-work used in its construction.”—“Bi News,” in <cite>The Wheel</cite>.</p>

  <p>This inventor, a Baltimorean, was probably not aware, at the time,
    that he was one of the earliest cycle inventors. The cut gives a clear
    illustration of working parts, the motion being quite like that of
    horseback riding. This patent might be considered an anticipation of
    the broad principle of the rear-driver as shown in some later machines.</p>

  <p>“<i>To all whom it may concern</i>:</p>

  <p>“Be it known that I, <span class="smcap">Charles A. Way</span>, of Charlestown, in the
    county of Sullivan, and State of New Hampshire, have invented certain
    new and useful Improvements in Velocipedes.</p>

  <p>“This invention consists in a novel arrangement of cranks and short
    axles with reference to the seat, side rails, and supporting-wheels
    of a velocipede, whereby the wheels may be operated to propel the
    apparatus with much greater facility than if the cranks were attached
    directly thereto.</p>

  <p>“The invention further consists in so arranging the cords that work
    the guiding-caster that they shall cross each other in such manner as
    to act more directly and consequently more efficiently upon the said
    caster than as hitherto applied.”</p>

  <p class="p2">Not apparently made for anybody to ride; “but in other respects a very
    good” velocipede.</p>

      20, 1866.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>“<i>To all whom it may concern</i>:</p>

  <p>“Be it known that I, <span class="smcap">Pierre Lallement</span>, of Paris, France,
    temporarily residing at New Haven, in the county of New Haven and State
    of Connecticut, have invented a new Improvement in Velocipedes; and
    I do hereby declare the following, when taken in connection with the
    accompanying drawings, and the letters of reference marked thereon, to
    be a full, clear, and exact description of the same, and which said
    drawings constitute part of this specification.</p>

  <p>“My invention consists in the arrangement of two wheels, the one
    directly in front of the other, combined with a mechanism for driving
    the wheels, and an arrangement for guiding, which arrangement also
    enables the rider to balance himself upon the two wheels.</p>

  <p>“By this construction of a velocipede, after a little practice, the
    rider is enabled to drive the same at an incredible velocity with the
    greatest ease.</p>

  <p>“Having, therefore, thus fully described my invention, what I claim as
    new and useful, and desire to secure by Letters Patent, is—</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span></p>

  <p>“The combination and arrangement of the two wheels <i>A</i> and
    <i>B</i>, provided with the treadles <i>F</i> and the guiding-arms
    <i>D</i>, so as to operate substantially as and for the purpose herein
    set forth.</p>

  <p class="right smcap">“Pierre Lallement.”</p>

  <p class="p2">This inventor has generally been accredited as being the first to
    apply cranks to the single-track machine; but priority is now claimed
    by Dalzell. If this claim be valid, Lallement would have to confine
    himself to the honor of being the first to apply the feet directly to
    the cranks, and to being the first patentee.</p>

  <p>It is stoutly maintained in Coventry that others had applied cranks, in
    a manner similar to that described in the foregoing specification, some
    time prior to the date of this patent; it is fair to say, however, that
    Lallement was the most energetic in pushing his invention, and that he
    did as much, if not more, than any other man in the great work which
    has now assumed such mammoth proportions.</p>

  <p>Considering the short time it has taken to firmly establish this new
    and useful mode of locomotion as a recognized necessity to mankind,
    there is little need to quarrel over the exact division of the honors;
    there is enough for all, and all will be in time duly credited with
    their respective claims.</p>

  <h4>REMARKS ON PATENT TO CHRISTIAN AND REINHART. VELOCIPEDE.</h4>

  <p>This drawing is a fine illustration of the practice of draughtsmen, in
    which they essay to impress upon the office and the public, by means of
    their deft pencils, the miraculous speed and easy locomotion attainable
    in their clients’ devices.</p>

  <p>This drawing has always been an amusing one to me, a bright spot in the
    tedious work of going through the patent files. Some wag of the office,
    having been similarly struck with the humor of this picture, embossed
    beneath the principal figure, in a large bold hand, the simple word
    “VELOX.” Now, I never happened to have a lexicon at hand in which to
    look up the exact meaning of the word, but I did not, for one moment,
    doubt its appropriateness. There seemed to be something in the word
    that carried conviction with it; if it did not mean anything pertinent
    to the subject, there was always a feeling that it ought to. In
    scanning patent drawings, in this art, I always turned “Velox” down so
    that when wearied by the toil of research, I could turn over the papers
    and smile at “Velox.”</p>

  <p>The modern drop-frame for tricycles and rear-driving bicycles would be
    a valuable improvement on Messrs. Christian and Reinhart’s invention;
    some of our ladies would object to a free exhibition of quite so much
    shoe-top.</p>

  <p>“The drawing represents a perspective view of my improved one-wheeled
    velocipede.</p>

  <p>“This invention relates to a certain improvement on that class of
    one-wheeled velocipedes in which the driver’s seat is arranged above
    the wheel, it being pivoted to the axle of the same.</p>

  <p>“The invention has for its object to provide for an easy balancing of
    the frame, and consists in attaching weights to the lower end of the
    seat-frame, whereby the same will be retained in a vertical position.</p>

  <p>“The balance can, with this weight-attachment, not be so readily lost
    as without it, and the operation of the one-wheeled velocipede is made
    easier and more practicable.</p>

  <p>“From the lower ends of the frame are suspended, as near to the ground
    as possible, weights <i>E</i>, <i>E</i>, which tend to keep the frame
    in a vertical position, and which are intended to balance the weight of
    the rider, so that the difficulty of holding the seat in the desired
    direction, above the axle, will be considerably reduced.</p>

  <p>“The velocipede may be propelled by means of foot-cranks <i>a</i>,
    <i>a</i>, or by other suitable mechanism.</p>

  <p>“Having thus described my invention,</p>

  <p>“What I claim as new, and desire to secure by Letters Patent, is,—</p>

  <p>“The weights <i>E</i>, <i>E</i>, suspended from the lower ends of

    strong, and the invention was really never patented before. Any one
    wishing to use it can do so now, however, as the patent has expired.
    I wish to call attention to the fact that the combined weights <i>E,
    E,</i> as arranged in drawing, need not exceed five hundred pounds in
    order to balance a hundred-and-sixty-pound man.</p>

  <p>“Be it known that I, <span class="smcap">John J. White</span>, of Philadelphia, in the
    county of Philadelphia and State of Pennsylvania, have invented a new
    and Improved Velocipede.</p>

  <p>“This invention relates to a new velocipede, which consists entirely
    of two wheels and their connecting-axles, the axles supporting a frame
    in which the seat and driving-gear are arranged, so that they can be
    conveniently operated. The wheels can, with this arrangement, be made
    very large, to obtain great velocity, and the whole apparatus can be
    made light and convenient.</p>

  <p>“The invention consists in the general arrangement of the apparatus,
    and, furthermore, in the special arrangement of a hinged seat which can
    be swung down when on going up-hill the rider desires to leave the seat
    and walk with the vehicle.</p>

  <p>“The invention also consists in the application of convenient brakes,
    by means of which the instrument can be conveniently stopped and
    steered.</p>

  <p>“The neck of the driver rests against the upper bar, <i>b</i>, which is
    hollowed for its reception, and which can be adjusted up and down on
    the bars <i>a</i>, to be adapted to the size of the rider.”</p>

  <p class="p2">Mr. White has at least provided some way to stop, and also to “walk
    with the vehicle,” if he should so desire, which we think he probably
    would.</p>

  <h4>SOME YOUNG AND STURDY “CHILDREN OF LARGER GROWTH” INVENT A WHIRLIGIG.</h4>

  <p>“This invention relates to a new and useful improvement in velocipedes,
    whereby they are better adapted to be employed as a medium of amusement
    and exercise for children and youth, as well as for ‘<em>children of a
    larger growth</em>.’ It is chiefly designed for use in play-grounds,
    lawns, gardens, and play-rooms; and</p>

  <p>“The invention consists in rotating a large horizontal wheel, formed
    of two concentric rings, tied together by bars, and supported on
    vertical wheels, each of which is revolved, by means of cranks, with
    the feet, after the manner of the common velocipede, thus rotating
    the main wheel, the construction, arrangement, and operation being as
    hereinafter more fully described.</p>

  <p>“The accompanying drawing is a perspective view of the combined
    velocipede, showing the manner of its construction and operation.</p>

  <p>“A represents the double-rimmed wheel, which may be made of any
    required diameter, and of any suitable material, and in any equivalent
    manner.</p>

  <p>“We do not confine ourselves to propelling by the feet exclusively. The
    driving-wheels may be rotated by the hands, as in some descriptions of
    velocipede, or by the feet and the weight of the body combined, as in
    the rocking-saddle kind.</p>

  <p>“Having thus described our invention,</p>

  <p>“What we claim as new, and desire to secure by Letters Patent, is,—</p>

  <p>2. A velocipede formed of a horizontal wheel or rim, when supported on
    vertical wheels adapted to be rotated by means of cranks, substantially
    as set forth.</p>

  <p>“The steering of the velocipede may be readily effected by the movement
    of the body, or by bringing one or other of the stirrups in contact
    with the ground. Owing to the roller on the stirrup, its contact with
    the ground will not interfere with the convenience of the operator.</p>

  <p>“Although I have shown the driving-wheel as arranged for being operated
    by hand, the ordinary treadle-devices used in connection with common
    velocipedes may be employed, so as to impart the desired movement to
    the wheel by the legs and feet of the operator.”</p>

  <p class="p2">This monocycle inventor has not forgotten to provide a means of
    steering, which is done by the stirrups. Simply tilting the body will
    not answer.</p>

  <h4>SCHMITT SPECIFICATION.</h4>

  <p>“The nature of my invention consists in constructing a velocipede
    with three wheels, one in front, for a guide, the other two in rear,
    connected together by a revolving axle.</p>

  <p>“The motive-power is communicated to the velocipede by means of
    machinery over the revolving axle and under the seat, which machinery
    is put in operation by the weight of and backward or forward motion of
    the occupant of the seat, or rider.</p>

  <p>“The operation of this machinery is as follows:</p>

  <p>“The weight of the rider upon the seat <i>o</i>, and a slight movement
    backward or forward causes the seat-support <i>g</i> to move backward
    or forward, which motion is communicated to the upright lever <i>f</i>
    by the connecting-bar <i>h</i>, which in turn starts the revolution of
    the driving-wheel axle <i>l</i>.</p>

  <p>“This movement of the lever <i>f</i> also gives a corresponding
    movement to the jointed levers <i>k</i>, <i>k</i>, and in such a way
    that one lever, <i>k</i>, is moving backward while the other is moving
    forward, and so one of the snappers, <i>l</i>, is always caught in
    the ratchet-wheel <i>e</i>, and assisting in the revolution of the
    driving-wheel axle <i>d</i>, and in this way the impelling force of the
    machine never ceases for an instant.</p>

  <p>“This revolution of the ratchet-wheel <i>e</i> forces the revolution
    of the driving-wheel <i>c</i>, which, by its connection with the
    pinion <i>b</i>, forces the revolution of the axle <i>A</i> and wheels
    <i>B</i>.”</p>

  <p class="p2">This patent shows a clever method of transmitting power by means of
    an oscillating motion of the body, and is valuable as a curiosity. The
    overcoat might be dispensed with, however, as it is not probable that
    the rider would need it even on the coldest of days.</p>

  <p>“<span class="smcap">To all to whom these presents shall come, I, William
    Leftwich</span>, of Tufnell Park West, Holloway, in the County of
    Middlesex, send greeting.</p>

  <p>“<span class="smcap">Whereas</span> Her most Excellent Majesty Queen Victoria, by Her
    Letters Patent, bearing date the Nineteenth day of July, in the year of
    our Lord One thousand eight hundred and sixty-nine, in the thirty-third
    year of Her reign, did, for Herself, Her heirs and successors, give

  <h4>HEMMINGS SPECIFICATION.</h4>

  <p>“This invention relates to a new and improved method of constructing
    and operating velocipedes, whereby they are made more durable, and at
    less expense, than heretofore; and</p>

  <p>“It consists in rotating a traction-wheel, by means of a
    traversing-wheel bearing on its inner surface, and revolved by the
    operator within the rim of the wheel, as hereinafter more fully
    described.</p>

  <p>“The propelling-power is applied to the band-wheels <i>E</i> by means
    of the hand-cranks <i>f</i>, <i>f</i>, leaving the feet of the operator
    at all times free.</p>

  <p>“In starting the velocipede, the first movement is given by the
    operator’s running or walking a short distance on the ground while
    astride the saddle. When a start is thus obtained, the motion is
    readily continued by turning the pulleys <i>E</i> with the hands.</p>

  <p>“When the weight is below the centre, and the feet near the ground,
    and always free, very little difficulty is experienced in balancing
    and guiding the machine; and, as numerous experiments have proved, the
    ease with which it is worked and the velocity obtained render it quite
    equal, if not superior to any velocipede in use, while the expense of
    constructing them is far less.</p>

  <p>“Having thus described my invention,</p>

  <h4>WORTMANN SPECIFICATION.</h4>

  <p>“This invention relates to a new vehicle, which is to be propelled
    by the upper or lower extremities of the person or persons which it
    supports, and which is provided with a fly-wheel in such a manner that
    the same may at will be thrown into or out of gear. This fly-wheel will
    gather power in going down-hill, and will then give it up in going
    up-hill, thereby facilitating the ascending of hills, and preventing
    too great rapidity while going down-hill.</p>

  <p>“The invention consists in the general combination of parts, whereby
    two persons may be accommodated on the vehicle, and also in the
    aforementioned arrangement of the fly-wheel.</p>

  <p>“When the fly-wheel is thrown into gear, as aforesaid, it will serve
    to gather power, to facilitate the riding up-hill, and to steady the
    motion down-hill.</p>

  <h4>SAWHILL SPECIFICATION.</h4>

  <p>“This invention relates to a new two- or three-wheeled velocipede,
    which is to be propelled by hand, and which is so constructed that it
    can be easily operated, and that the body will be sustained in the most
    advantageous position.</p>

  <p>“The invention consists in several improvements of the
    driving-mechanism, of the foot-supports, and steering-mechanism,
    which, separately or combined, tend to produce a simple and convenient
    apparatus.</p>

  <p>“<i>A</i>, in the drawing, represents the front wheel of my improved
    velocipede.</p>

  <p>“The rider, holding the feet on these fixed bars <i>I</i>, can readily,
    and by an imperceptible motion, turn the post to guide the apparatus in
    any desired direction.</p>

  <p>“I claim as new, and desire to secure by Letters Patent,—</p>

  <p>“1. The steering-post <i>C</i>, constructed, as described, of the two
    parallel bars <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, hung upon the crank-axle <i>B</i>,
    and connected by the plates <i>b</i>, <i>d</i>, between which the end

  <p class="center">“There are only a few of us left.”</p>

  <p>“This invention relates to a new and useful improvement in velocipedes,
    and consists in the method in which power is applied for driving it.</p>

  <p>“Power is applied to this ratchet by means of the pawls <i>f</i> and
    <i>g</i>, the former of which is pivoted to the frame <i>h</i>, and to
    which the saddle <i>i</i> is attached; the other pawl is pivoted to the
    frame J, to which the foot-pieces <i>k</i> are attached.</p>

  <p>“When the weight of the rider is thrown either upon the saddle or upon
    the foot-pieces, the pawls act upon the ratchet-wheel, and rotate the
    axle.</p>

  <p>“As before stated, motion is given the velocipede by working the pawls
    in the ratchet-wheel, as the weight of the rider is thrown alternately
    upon the saddle and upon the foot-pieces.</p>

  <p>“This operation gives him the motion and exercise of a <em>horseback</em>
    ride.</p>

  <p>“No crank is employed, and consequently the vehicle may be started at
    any point, and the operating parts being attached to and supported by
    the main axle, there is nothing likely to break or get out of order.</p>

  <p>“Having thus described my invention,</p>

  <p>“What I claim as new, and desire to secure by Letters Patent, is,—</p>

  <p>“1. In combination with a velocipede, the ratchet-wheel <i>E</i>, pawls
    <i>f</i> and <i>g</i>, and yokes <i>h</i> and <i>J</i>, arranged and
    operating on the axle <i>A</i>, substantially as described.</p>

  <p>“This invention has for its object to so construct the cranks of
    velocipedes that they are made longer where the greatest power is
    required, without increasing the diameter of the circle to be described
    by the foot.</p>

  <p>“The invention consists in the use of sliding cranks, which project
    from both sides of the shaft.</p>

  <p>“One end of each crank is guided by a fixed eccentric<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span> groove or track,
    in such manner that the crank-pin is moved away from the shaft as long
    as the power is applied to the same by the foot. When the power is not
    required, on the return stroke, the crank-pin is drawn close to the
    shaft, and thus, without describing a large circle, the crank-lever is
    made longer than usual, when required.</p>

  <p>“Thus, a twelve-inch crank-bar can produce a nine- or ten-inch
    working-crank, while the crank-pin describes a circle of not more than
    twelve inches diameter. Heretofore, a twelve-inch circle was described
    by a six-inch crank. Greater leverage and power are thus obtained by my
    invention.</p>

  <p class="right smcap">“Edwd. A. Lewis.”</p>

  <p class="p2">This is one of the most deceptive schemes in cycle history; if it
    worked as the inventor implies, we should have perpetual motion in
    fact. A man cannot transmit power to the wheel while the crank is
    coming up, except the little he can get by ankle-motion. A close
    examination will show that, whereas the crank is longer, the man has a
    proportionally less number of degrees through which he can drive it.
    Time, as well as force, enters into the problem of driving a bicycle;
    the time is equal to the number of degrees the crank travels through;
    here a man only has one-third, or less, of the circle, through which
    he has any power to turn the wheel. It is of no advantage to have
    one-third longer leverage if you have one-third, or over, less time,
    or number of degrees, to transmit power. The enormous mistake of this
    inventor consists in the fact that it would actually be better if he
    transmitted his power through the arc of short, rather than that of
    the long, leverage. If you do not increase your vertical amplitude,
    or resultant, depend upon it you cannot increase your power unless,
    at least, you push through a comparable number of degrees at better
    advantage.</p>

  <p>“The saddle <i>I</i> may be made adjustable longitudinally on
    the balance-beam <i>E</i>, or it may be made to slide thereon
    longitudinally.</p>

  <p>“A hand-lever, <i>K</i>, pivoted to the reach, and connected with the
    crank <i>g</i>, serves to throw the crank off the centre in starting
    the vehicle.</p>

  <p>“The saddle <i>I</i> may be a side-saddle for ladies’ use, and two
    removable saddles may be provided for a single vehicle, one of which
    may be a side-saddle, and in this way a single velocipede may be used
    either by a gentleman or lady, or by boys and girls.</p>

  <p>“The operation of the invention is as follows: The rider throws his
    weight alternately on the treadle and on the seat, rising on his feet
    when throwing his weight on the treadle, and lowering himself upon the
    saddle again, <em>as in riding a galloping horse</em>. In this way the
    entire weight of the body is utilized, both in rising and falling, to
    propel the vehicle, the muscles being used in a far more advantageous
    manner, and furnishing a much more healthful exercise than in the
    propulsion of a velocipede by the use of first one foot and then the
    other in the highly-disadvantageous method of applying muscular power
    heretofore employed.”</p>

  <p class="p2">Good for Mr. Hornig! But he will have to get his galloping velocipede
    on the market pretty soon or his patent will expire.</p>

  <h4>“THE COVENTRY TRICYCLE.</h4>

  <p>“The tricycle, as it is designated, shown in the accompanying
    engraving, consists of a rectangular frame made of iron or steel tube,
    which carries a double-cranked shaft in patent parallel bearings.
    The driving wheel, forty-two inches in diameter, is arranged on a
    left-hand side of the rider; and the other side of the rectangular
    frame is produced, front and back, for carrying the forks of two
    22-inch steering wheels. These forks are connected by a rod, fixed to
    the outside of one and the inside of the other, so that both wheels are
    turned together by the steering handle. The effect of this arrangement
    is that the rider is enabled to thread his way between other vehicles
    with the greatest ease; and it is even said that he can describe a
    figure 8 in a length of twelve feet. The seat is mounted on four steel
    springs of S form, which are attached to the frame by nuts on the
    screwed ends of the stays carrying the pin on which the pedals work.
    Rods jointed to the pedals turn the crank-shaft, as will be seen in the
    engraving. The second handle is merely to afford support for the left
    hand while the right is occupied in steering.</p>

  <p>“The tricycle is fitted with tangent wheels, in which the spokes are
    crossed, and each spoke locks the other. By this arrangement greater
    lightness can be obtained for a given strength; and another great
    advantage is that in the event of a spoke being broken, another can
    be replaced by the rider in a few minutes. The machine can be readily
    taken to pieces and packed in small compass.”</p>

  <p class="p2">This is the pattern of tricycle shown upon the Starley monument
    at Coventry, and is that which was afterwards changed from the
    lever-motion to the crank and sprocket-chain, and extensively
    manufactured at a great works in the Cycle City.</p>

  <p>“<i>To all whom it may concern</i>:</p>

  <p>“Be it known that I, <span class="smcap">Elbridge Baker</span>, of Salem, in the county
    of Essex and State of Massachusetts, have invented Improvements in
    Wagons, of which the following is a specification:</p>

  <p>“This improvement in wagons consists in mechanism arranged, as
    hereinafter described, to act directly on the ground to propel the
    wagon.</p>

  <p>“Each rod has a pronged foot-piece, <i>f</i>, and between the
    foot-piece <i>f</i> and the crank-hanging of each rod the rod is
    suspended by a flexible line, <i>g</i>, from the body of the wagon.</p>

  <p>“Turning the crank-shaft <i>b</i> in any suitable manner causes the
    pronged foot-pieces, <i>f</i> of the rods <i>d<sup>1</sup></i>, <i>d<sup>2</sup></i>,
    <i>d<sup>4</sup></i>, and <i>d<sup>5</sup></i> to take hold of the ground, and thereby
    propel the wagon, and by arranging the cranks as is shown in the
    drawings one rod after the other is brought into and out of action,
    securing a continuous action of the mechanism to propel the wagon, all
    as is obvious without further explanation.</p>

  <p>“The lines <i>g</i> hold and keep the rods to the action of their
    crank-arms, and cause the rods to be properly brought, from time to
    time, by the cranks into operating positions on the ground.”</p>

  <p class="p2">This device is a logical sequence of Mr. Croft’s, being a combination
    of shoving-bars worked by machinery instead of by hand. This patent is
    now expired and can be used by anybody.</p>

    other suitable means, whereby the carriage may be propelled by the feet

    or the hand-shaft may be employed, when desired, to aid or assist the
    feet, as circumstances may require; or both sets of pulleys may be used

      May 31, 1881.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p class="noindent">“<i>To all whom it may concern</i>:</p>

  <p>“Be it known that I, <span class="smcap">G. Battista Scuri</span>, a citizen of the
    Kingdom of Italy, residing at Turin, have invented new and useful
    Improvements in Velocipedes.</p>

  <p>“My invention relates to improvements in that class of velocipedes
    called ‘monocycles,’ in which but one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span> wheel is employed, that serves
    both as a propelling and steering wheel.</p>

  <p>“The velocipedes which have heretofore been chiefly used are the
    bicycle and the tricycle, and to a limited extent the quadricycle, or
    four-wheeled velocipede, in all of which the support for the driver
    is so arranged as to practically throw his weight upon the front and
    rear wheel axles. The power required to propel these various species
    of conveyances increases proportionally with the number of wheels
    employed, and the relative diameters of the latter, as well as the
    mechanism employed for propelling and steering the same, together with
    the weight of the apparatus. It is obvious therefore that the power
    required to propel these conveyances diminishes proportionally with the
    number of the elements referred to. Consequently, to reduce this power
    to a minimum, it will only be necessary to correspondingly reduce the
    number of propelling-wheels, the propelling and steering mechanism, and
    the weight of the apparatus.</p>

  <p>“To obtain these results I employ but one wheel.</p>

  <p>“In a monocycle that is constructed to support the entire weight of
    its driver, it is absolutely necessary that said weight, as well as
    that of the supports for the same and all other mechanism, either for
    propelling or steering, should be thrown upon the one wheel-axle and be
    adapted to be equally balanced thereon.</p>

  <p>“By means of this construction and arrangement I obtain a velocipede
    that can be propelled with comparatively little fatigue, and the cost
    of construction of which is reduced nearly one-half of that of the
    ordinary velocipede.”</p>

  <p class="p2">Judging from this invention they must be expert riders in every way in
    Italy; it must be supposed that the inventor at least could manage it.
    If reducing the mechanism increases the power in such a proportion, why
    not do away with all mechanism and have infinite power?</p>

  <h4>SMITH SPECIFICATION.</h4>

  <p>“The rider is supported upon a seat or saddle, <i>Q</i>, directly above
    the stirrups, in a nearly standing position, his feet resting upon
    the stirrups, and he operates the clutches alternately by a walking
    movement, or he can operate the mechanism in a standing position
    without the seat or saddle. The clutch-levers alternately engage with
    the rims or pulleys on the axle, as their outer ends are pressed
    downward by the backward walking movement of the foot of the rider, and
    releasing them as the foot rises in stepping forward, the rope reeving
    through the pulleys in each direction alternately as the levers are
    alternately raised and depressed.</p>

  <p>“The operation will then be as follows: When a downward pressure is
    applied to one lever its lower arm or prong, <i>g′</i>, pressing upon
    the face of the disk <i>F</i>, draws the case or frame forward, so
    as to press the rollers <i>h</i> against the face of the disk, thus
    clutching or gripping the disk at three points, so as to clamp the
    frame or case to it. The downward pressure of the lever then turns the
    disk and axle until the lever of the opposite clutch has gripped the
    other disk in the same way.</p>

  <p>“In a four-wheeled carriage a seat or body can be placed upon the front
    part of the vehicle for carrying another person or parcels.</p>

  <p>“I thus provide a vehicle that is propelled by a walking movement
    similar to that employed in operating the bicycle. It can be operated
    with very little exertion, and it enables the rider to carry another
    person or packages, if he desires.”</p>

  <p class="p2">This gallant tandem inventor was at least not guilty of requiring his
    lady to do any work.</p>

  <h4>HULL AND O’REAR SPECIFICATION.</h4>

  <p>“This invention consists of the construction and arrangement, as
    hereinafter described, of a vehicle to be propelled and guided by the
    rider, the driving-power being applied by means of hand-cranks and the
    guiding being effected by the foot of the operator.</p>

  <p>“<i>A</i> represents the hind axle, whereon the two hind wheels,
    <i>B</i>, are fitted by means of the well-known rose-clutch device
    <i>C</i>, the frame <i>H</i>, and turned by hand-cranks <i>I</i>, to be
    worked by the operator, who sits upon the saddle <i>J</i>.</p>

  <p>“We have also arms, <i>Y</i>, for the application of the feet of the
    operator to steer the vehicle, while the lever ranges rearward towards
    the operator for being conveniently worked by hand.</p>

  <p>“The construction is very simple and cheap, and the arrangement is
    calculated to afford a convenient and easily-operated hand-power
    vehicle.”</p>

  <p class="p2">Messrs. Hull and O’Rear find that it is better to steer with the feet
    and propel the machine by the arms. The rider is peering anxiously
    forward as though somebody was ahead of him, and he appears rather
    disconcerted from some cause; which makes us think the picture has been
    taken from real life.</p>

    hereinafter described and claimed.</p>

  <p>“The operator may stand erect, and in order to obtain the necessary
    vertical space without too large a wheel the rim or felly is made of
    considerable width, as shown in Fig. 2. With this wide tire the wheel
    will stand without support, and I prefer to use a recessed tire or two
    smaller tires, as shown, between which is a rubber or elastic band to
    prevent concussion and noise.</p>

  <p>“To allow of entering the machine, a portion, <i>c′</i>, of one felly
    is made separate, and the hub <i>a</i> made with a hinged segment,

  <h4>BURLINGHAUSEN SPECIFICATION.</h4>

  <p>“My invention relates to improvements in one-wheel velocipedes; and
    it consists in certain features of construction and in combination of
    parts hereinafter described, and pointed out in the claim.</p>

  <p>“As the operator must sit some distance back of the axis of the wheel,
    some force is required to support or balance the seat and operate in
    the required position, and this is furnished by the sliding weight
    <i>H</i> secured by a set-screw on the rod <i>G</i>.</p>

  <p>“What I claim is,—</p>

  <p>“In a one-wheel velocipede, the combination, with the hubs, the hangers
    <i>D</i>, depending from said hubs, and cranks secured to the hubs
    for revolving the wheel, of the cross-piece <i>E</i>, the balance-rod
    provided with the adjustable foot-rest, and the seat secured to the
    upper surface of the cross-bar, substantially as described.</p>

    witnesses, this sixth day of March, 1884.</p>

  <p class="right smcap">“Bernerd G. Burlinghausen.”</p>

  <p class="p2">This device works entirely as a manumotor or hand-carriage. It is
    questionable if any prudent rider would care to be enclosed within this
    structure if there were many hills to descend. To be sure, if the seat
    gets fast, he can kick the spokes, as in the case of a squirrel and
    cage-reel, thus keeping himself upright, but this would be attended
    with great labor and requisite skill.</p>

  <h4>COMBINED BICYCLE AND ACCORDION, PATENTED BY MR. VON MALKOWSKY.</h4>

  <p>Just fills a need long felt by the cyclist. There is a certain action
    claimed for it, in which pressure of air is used on the treadles which
    helps to propel the machine; but this is only a secondary element in
    the mind of the wary cyclist; no sooner will he see this invention than
    he will grasp the idea of getting keys to it and having it play him a
    tune, as he speeds on his lonely way. And then, how nice to sit down,
    unscrew a pedal, remove his treasure, and produce sweet strains of
    silvery music. A new short method of instruction for playing upon this
    new combination may go with each cycle sold, such that any rider could
    soon comprehend. Below find brief of specification.</p>

  <p>“From the lower ends of the fork <i>C</i> extend, in downwardly or
    backwardly direction, fixed brackets, <i>C′</i>, to which are applied
    closed expansible bellows, <i>D</i>, of oblong shape, one at each side
    of the driving-wheel <i>A</i>.</p>

  <p>“The combination, in a velocipede, with the driving-wheel, of closed

    Improved Bicycle Safety Attachment for Learners, of which the following
    is a specification.</p>

  <p>“If the wheels <i>B</i> be raised from the ground a short distance,
    considerable swaying of the machine will be possible without its quite
    tumbling over.</p>

  <p>“As shown in Fig. 2, the wheels are upon the same level as the large
    wheel, and the machine is well supported, so that a person ignorant
    of the art of riding a bicycle can ride a machine fitted with this
    appliance.”</p>

  <p class="p2">This is another gentleman who thinks he can balance the bicycle by
    means of out-riggers. However ridiculous this scheme may be, this
    inventor does not deserve the first prize. A machine shown at one of
    the London exhibitions, in which the two small wheels were replaced
    by iron sled-runners, should be the subject of our highest award. The
    inventor of our machine shown can well say that a person need not be
    able to ride; I recommend he make himself expert at headers, however.</p>

    of New Jersey, have invented certain new and useful Improvements in
    One-Wheeled Vehicles.</p>

  <p>“My invention relates to a unicycle or one-wheeled vehicle, without
    spokes, which will carry one or more persons, as well as a bicycle or

    inside, and only one wheel touching the ground. I attain these objects
    by the means of the devices illustrated in the accompanying drawings.</p>

  <p>“When the machine is not in operation, it will stand by itself, for the
    treadle and driving wheels being heavier than the idler-wheel <i>H</i>,
    <i>H</i> will rise and the front part of platform will drop, and the
    treadle-wheels will rest on the ground.”</p>

  <p class="p2">Mr. Lose drew his unicycle in better proportions than his man; perhaps
    he made the rider’s limbs light to show that the machine would run easy.</p>

  <h4>LAWSON SPECIFICATION.</h4>

  <p>“My invention relates to that class of bicycles in which the front
    wheel is employed for steering and the rear wheel for driving, the
    pedal crank-axle being arranged between the wheels and connected with
    the axle of the rear wheel for driving by an endless driving-chain.</p>

  <p>“The object in this construction is to secure the rider against being
    thrown forward over the front wheel by keeping his centre of gravity
    low and setting his seat or saddle as far back as is practicable from
    the centre of the front wheel. This mode of driving through the medium
    of sprocket-wheels and chains also allows the driving-wheel to be
    geared up or down to suit individual tastes.</p>

  <p>“What I do claim is,—</p>

  <p>“1. A bicycle having two wheels arranged tandem as shown, the rear
    wheel being no larger than the front wheel, and provided with a
    pedal crank-axle arranged between said wheels and connected to the
    rear wheel, for driving by an endless chain and sprocket-wheel,
    substantially as specified.”</p>

  <p class="p2">The other drawing of this patent is used to illustrate the Rover
    rear-driver. I wish to call particular attention to the claim as given
    in above brief of specification, as it is somewhat extraordinary. The
    English patent to this same inventor would indicate that he was an
    early, but negligent, inventor of the modern rear-driver safety.</p>

  <h4>A. HOAK’S VELOCIPEDE.</h4>

  <p>The important part of the specification is as follows:</p>

  <p>“The shaft-gearing of these spur-wheels consists of impact roller
    motions, so that the crank centrally on the shaft, within easy reach
    of the operator upon the seat and between the driving-wheels, may be
    effectually operated by the hand, and a lever from the guide-wheel is
    designed to be in such a position as to be within easy reach of the
    operator’s feet forwardly, so that no difficulty will be encountered,
    all of which will now be fully set forth.</p>

  <p>“The operation of this device is very simple. The operator seated
    within the machine operates the crank <i>O</i> of the shaft <i>L</i>,
    and the spur-wheels <i>N</i>, engaging with the spur-wheels <i>I</i>,
    move the vehicle forward. The steering-wheel <i>C</i> is operated by
    the feet in connection with the lever <i>E</i>.”</p>

  <p class="p2">It is all right, except that it would seem cruel to have such legs as
    the draughtsman has given the rider, and only use them for steering
    purposes.</p>

  <h4>BURBANK SPECIFICATION.</h4>

  <p>“By thus providing the bicycle with a circular track engaging the
    driving-wheel the said track forms virtually the driving-wheel of the
    bicycle or velocipede, and as it is of very greatly increased diameter
    as compared with the driving-wheel of the velocipede, it enables the
    machine to be driven over rough and uneven roads without violent
    bumping and jolting, and without discomfort to the rider. It also
    prevents the velocipede from being overturned when it encounters an
    obstruction, and prevents the rider from ‘taking a header.’</p>

  <p>“When the machine encounters a stone or other obstruction, the
    frame <i>M</i> is moved rearwardly against the pressure of the
    spring <i>L′</i>, and thus causing the wheel <i>B</i> and the rider
    to be moved forwardly past the centre of the circular track for a
    corresponding distance, thus enabling the weight of the rider to be
    utilized in causing the circular track to pass over the obstruction.”</p>

  <p class="p2">This patent is a fair sample of the big-wheel idea; it has some
    good features, such as the spring <i>L′</i>, which allows the inside
    machine, together with the rider, to swing forward when the outer
    wheel strikes an obstacle, thus acting as an anti-vibrator or momentum
    spring. The small inner wheel with cranks would make the machine run
    slow, but the appearance of the thing would be, I think, rather unique.</p>

  <p>“The advantages of my back support or rest for a bicycle seat will be
    readily understood by users of the machine.</p>

  <p>“Instead of folding the rest down upon the seat as shown, it might be
    arranged to be folded down behind the seat, if desired.</p>

  <p>“I am aware that various forms of seats have been provided with hinged
    back-rests, and do not claim, broadly, a seat having a hinged back-rest.</p>

  <p>“I claim as my invention—</p>

  <p>“In combination with the frame and an ordinary seat of a bicycle,
    an arm secured at one end to the frame under the seat and extending
    upwardly at the back of the seat, and a back-rest located behind the
    seat and having hinge-connection with the arm above the top of the
    seat, whereby it is adapted to be folded down, substantially as set
    forth.</p>

  <p class="right smcap">“Catherine A. Williamson.”</p>

  <p class="p2">Miss Williamson is mistaken in her disclaimer. I do not think anybody
    ever put a back on a bicycle seat before.</p>

  <p>It is also probable that a “dis” (before advantages) was omitted
    by the printer in the first line of above brief; but we must not
    be ungallant to the ladies, and criticise too harshly. Perhaps the
    invention will come in on the Rovers where the ladies may mount in
    front.</p>

  <h4>DURYEA SPECIFICATION.</h4>

  <p>“The improvement relates partly to the handle-bars, partly to the
    pedals, and partly to the head, of the bicycle.</p>

  <p>“The advantage of this form of handle-bars is that it enables the rider
    to mount from in rear of the large wheel in the usual manner, and to
    dismount either in the rear or in the front of the large wheel. It also
    permits of an upward pull upon the handle in propelling the wheel.</p>

  <p>“The structure of the spokes, hub, and rim will not be claimed in this
    case, as they will form the subject of another application by me for
    patent thereon.</p>

  <p>“I am aware that heretofore the handle-bar has been angled, but know of
    no case where it extends backwardly, outwardly, and upwardly.”</p>

  <p class="p2">This idea for handle-bars has often occurred to riders of the old
    Ordinary; it would have saved many serious falls, by way of the front
    dismount, heads down. The weight and complication are its defects.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span></p>

  <h4>LATTA SPECIFICATION.</h4>

  <p>“The object of this invention is to provide a machine which is safe,
    strong, and serviceable, and more easily steered than the machines
    now in use, and also to construct the machine in such manner that the
    same can be folded when not required for use, so as to require little
    storage-room and facilitate its transportation.</p>

  <p>“In bicycles of ordinary construction, when the rider anticipates
    a fall it is customary to turn the steering-wheel in the direction
    towards which the rider is inclined to fall. When the steering-wheel of
    my improved velocipede is deflected, the saddle swings in an opposite
    direction to that in which the rider tends to fall, which enables
    the rider to regain his balance with very little movement of the
    steering-pivot, and also to maintain a direct course with greater ease
    than with the ordinary machines.”</p>

  <p class="p2">This is one of Mr. Latta’s weekly patents, and is a sample of the many
    efforts now being made to overcome the sensitive steering qualities of
    the recent rear-driver. The invention is also intended to answer the
    purpose of the “Rothigiesser system,” spoken of in a former chapter.</p>

    adjustably pivoted to uprights on the frame, one of the ends of the
    crank-handle having a sprocket-wheel connected by an endless chain with
    a sprocket-wheel on the axle of the driving-wheels, while the other
    end of the crank-handle has two fly-wheels to steady the motion of the
    machine, and so that but little exertion will be required to run it
    after a high degree of momentum has been obtained.”</p>

  <h4>AN AMERICAN BONE-SHAKER, 1869.</h4>

  <p>As it is a common practice to present patrons with a portrait of the
    venturesome culprit who aspires to engage the temporary notice of the
    public, by works of this kind, it is possible that some readers may,
    perchance, procure books with such expectations in view, and feel
    disappointed if no such custom has prevailed. Now, therefore, the
    writer has overhauled his effects and brought to light a picture which,
    “though not as new as it was,” is a fair specimen of the photographer’s
    handicraft, which represents your hopeful tyro upon his original
    velocipede, one made by himself in 1868–69. This machine was probably
    the earliest single-track crank-machine made in the State of Ohio and
    one of the first in the United States.</p>
